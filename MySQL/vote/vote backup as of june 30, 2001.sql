ANG PARTY-LIST ELECTIONS
<P>
Alinsunod sa itinatadhana ng Konstitusyon at ng Republic Act 7941, ipinatupad ang party-list election sa bansa noong nakaraang Mayo 11, 1998. 
<P> 
Layunin ng party-list system na magkaroon ng pagkakataon ang maliliit na partido na kumakatawan sa mga tinatawag na \"marginalized\" at \"underrepresented\" na sektor gaya ng manggagawa, magsasaka, maralitang lungsod, kababaihan, atbp. na magkaroon ng representasyon sa Kongreso. 
Dalawampung porsyento (20%) ng kabuuang pwesto sa Kongreso ay inilaan sa party-list system. Noong 1998, 14 lang sa dapat ay 52 nakalaang pwesto ang nakuha ng 13  party-list organizations.  Isa sa mga nanalo ang Sanlakas.
<P>
Ang isang party-list organization ay makakakuha ng isang pwesto kung makakalikom ito ng minimum na 2% ng kabuuang boto sa party-list. Bawat partido ay pinapayagang makakuha ng maksimum na tatlong (3) pwesto.
Halimbawa: Kung ang kabuuang boto sa party-list ay umabot ng 20 milyon, ang isang partido ay dapat makakuha ng 400,000 boto para makakuha ng isang pwesto, 800,000 sa dalawang pwesto at 1.2 milyon sa tatlong pwesto. 
<P>
Sa party-list system, ang ibinoboto  ay partido, hindi tao.
<P>
Halimbawa, sa balota:
<P>
Senator: Maria <BR>
District Representative: Juan <BR>
Party-List Representative: SANLAKAS <BR>
<P>
Kaya\'t tandaan, ngayong eleksyon, dalawa ang ating iboboto sa Kongreso. Isang District Representative at isang Party-List Representative.

Dear Friends,

There is less than one month before the May 14 National Elections.

The National Movement for Free Elections has finally been given the
mandate the to conduct its OPERATION QUICK COUNT based of the official
sixth copy of the Precinct Election Return (based on Comelec Resolution
SPP No. 00-040 dated 05 April 2001).

Because of the delays caused by opposition to NAMFREL\'s accrediation
by ceratin interest blocks, our preparation have been extremely
limited and delayed.

We are in urgent need of volunteers, logistics and donations.  We are
handling NAMFREL Quezon City covering more than one million votes in
four districts.  Quezon City has the greatest number of voters of any
municipality, city or province.

If you are interested to volunteer as a voting center manager, precinct
volunteer or data courier to help gather the base data from Quezon City\'s
more than 5000 precincts from 3PM May 14 to 9AM May 15.

Please write to ramirez@i-manila.com.ph. If you are interested to
donate to the effort, please contact Raymund Magadaluyo at 0917-
8326861 or Rissa Ramos pframos@pacific.net.ph.

We shall have a volunteer training seminar on Satruday, April 21,
from 9AM to 12NN at the Ateneo College Campus, Loyola Hts. Quezon
City.

WE URGENTLY NEED YOUR HELP. WE ARE VERY SHORT ON VOLUNTEERS AND
LOGISTICS.  YOU NEED NOT BE FROM QUEZON CITY TO VOLUNTEER OR SUPPORT
OUR EFFORTS.


Thank you. For God and country.

Please pass this on to friends and relatives.

NEWS RELEASE<BR>
April 24, 2001<BR>
<BR><BR>
<P>
Local leader of PM killed
<P>
At around 7:00 last night, two gunmen shot and killed Manuel Ibe, president of the 1,300-strong labor union of Liwayway Manufacturing and founding member of labor party-list group Partido ng Manggagawa (PM) chapter in Cavite. He was slain in front of the factory gates in Imus as he was going home from work.
<P>
Ibe is a leader of PM in Cavite and was a prominent figure in the group\'s successful province-wide motorcade and chapter founding assembly last Sunday. He is the second leader of the PM to be slain in almost three months, following the assassination of militant labor leader Ka Popoy Lagman last February 6. 
<P>
The group\'s Cavite chapter announced that it will launch mass actions to demand the immediate capture of the suspects and the swift resolution of the murder case.
<P>
According to PM national chairman Renato Magtubo, \"The perpetrators of this grisly act are undoubtedly enemies of the working class. Dark and sinister forces want to derail the PM as they are threatened by labor\'s active participation in mainstream politics.
<P>
\"While the slaying of Ka Popoy was meant to intimidate the PM, which was then in the heat of preparation for its National Founding Congress, the murder of Manuel Ibe intends to terrorize the PM Cavite chapter after its successful founding assembly.\"
<P>
Magtubo added, \"However, we will not be cowed. The party will persevere on its aims and objectives.\"
<P>
He said, \"With barely a few days before Labor Day, militant labor leaders who sincerely strive for the interest of the working class in the parliamentary arena face the iron hand of repression and harassment. If government continuously fails to address this, labor will be forced to struggle through non-parliamentary means.\"
<P>
The group decried the \"evolving pattern of repression against the PM\". Early this month, Reynaldo Lopez, PM organizer for Cavite was arrested. He was released after 3 days of incarceration. ###

STATEMENT on the pro-Estrada \"Edsa 3\"<BR>
27 April 2001<BR>
SANLAKAS<BR>
<BR>
KAPANGYARIHAN PARA SA MASA,<BR>
HINDI KAY ERAP O GLORIA!<BR>
<P>
    Ang Sanlakas ay nananawagan sa mga kapatid naming maralita - kung ilulunsad natin ang Edsa 3, ito ay dapat para sa ating mahihirap hindi pa para kay Erap. Kung totohanang ilulunsad ng mahihirap ang Edsa 3, gawin natin ito para sa ating sariling interes at hindi para maibalik lang si Erap sa poder. 
<P>
    Sa mga kapatid naming maralita, huwag nating hatiiin ang ating hanay sa pagitan ng pro-Gloria o pro-Erap. Tayo ay pare-pareho ng kapalaran bilang mahihirap. Pero kami ay naniniwala na ang ating katubusan ay wala kay Gloria o kay Erap. 
<P>
    Maaring pareho ang ating damdamin na binigo ng dalawang Edsa ang mga mithiin ng mahihirap. Kami sa Sanlakas ay di rin kuntento na ang resulta ng Edsa Dos ay pag-akyat lang sa poder ni Gloria. Pero ang maglunsad ng Edsa 3 para lamang ibalik si Erap ay mas malaking trahedya. Si Erap ay nagkasala at dapat lang humarap sa hustisya.
<P>
    Kayat huwag nating ulitin sa ikatlong pagkakataon ang pagkakamali ng dalawang Edsa. Sa halip, hinangin natin ang pagkakaisa sa pagitan nating mahihirap para ipaglaban ang ating sariling interes - ang kapakanan ng mga mahihirap. Sa ganitong paraan, mas posible ang pagbabago kaysa manatili tayo sa pagpanig sa pagitan ni Erap at ni Gloria.  
<P>
    Kung gusto natin ng pababago, dapat nagkakaisa tayong kumilos para baguhin ang sistema ng ating bansa - ang pulitika sa ating bayan. Dapat nating likhain ang sariling lakas at kilusan laban sa lahat ng trapo sa ating bansa. Ang kapangyarihan ay dapat hawak nating mahihirap hindi ng mga gaya ni Gloria at ni Erap.
<P>
    Nananawagan din kami sa pamahalaan na huwag gumamit ng dahas sa protestang nagaganap sa Edsa. Karapatan ng mamamayan na maglunsad ng ganitong protesta, anuman ang kanilang paniniwala. 
<P>
    Sa huli ay nagbibigay din kami ng babala kay Gloria na huwag balewalain ang namumuong daluyong ng masa sila man ay pro-Erap. Naniniwala kami na bukod sa kanilang simpatiya sa kanilang idolo ay naroon sa kanilang damdamin ang paghahanap ng totoong pagbabago.(30)

      the insurance for volunteers (yes, we are insured for the
      princely sum of P50,000!) oh, well, we were going to serve,
      anyway, even without insurance...

   b. your residence phone no. so i can call you, if necessary,
      over the weekend

      your school/precinct assignments, please enter the cell #
      of your respective VCMs too

2. don\'t forget to make a TRANSPARENT PLASTIC JACKET for the
   namfrel ID, with provisions for hanging around your neck. this 
   is VERRY IMPORTANT as it\'s the only way to ensure that the ID,
   which you will need to claim the PRECIOUS 6TH COPY OF THE
   ELECTION RETURNS, won\'t get lost.

1. your cell phone -- fully charged, w/ an extra battery if you have one

5. pen & paper
6. black pentel pen (for printing your name on the ID card)
7. face towel
8. tissue (facial or otherwise)
9. loaded camera, with flash
10.and FOOD, glorious FOOD!
   (i\'m sorry about this. i know i had earlier said that we shall
   be given packed supper, but tony esteban (the namfrel-makati chair)
   says funds are low this time and the best they can do is to send
   sandwiches. i have, however, been able to ask for packed supper for
   our group from chowking (a client of mine), so we\'ll have a full
   meal for supper. we can save the namfrel sandwich for midnight
   snack or something. however, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BRING YOUR OWN FOOD,
   PLUS SOME CANDY, CRACKERS, OR WHATEVER)

   i also asked for bottled water to go with the packed supper from 
   chowking. i thought it better than soft drinks (hope no one minds)

11. PLASTIC JACKET for ID (kulit, no?)

i hope, PRAY, that no one will back out now. am grateful for the new recruits that some of you have referred to me. i truly hope no one will
get intimidated by rumors/news of bomb threats. methinks we\'re made of sterner stuff....

let\'s pray that his political exercise will help move our country forward, as it should. (hope our candidates win, too!)


KEEP THIS IN MIND, please:

     NAMFREL\'S MANDATE IS TO DO A QUICK COUNT.
     THE NAMFREL COUNT WILL BE BEASED ON OFFICIAL
          ELECTION RETURNS GATHERED FROM THE PRECINCTS.

PEOPLE POWER VS. POWER BILL<BR>
<P>
We express our collective resolve to block the passage of the omnibus power bill in the special session of Congress called by President GMA. Against the cute infomercials of GMA and the threats of massive blackouts by Camacho, we are preparing a people power versus the power bill. Daily mobilizations will hound the deliberations of the power bill to warn the honorable members of Congress against betraying the people.
<P>
This pet bill of FVR, Erap and Ate Glo is against the interests of the Filipino people and in favor of big business. The latest proposed amendments to the power bill are merely token concessions that do not alter its anti-people essence which is the privatization of Napocor and its transfer into the hands of the Lopezes and Aboitizes.
<P>
Even the proposed lowering of the power purchase adjustment or PPA from P1.00/kwH to P0.70/kwH is 70 centavos more than what is just and necessary. The consumers should not bear the heavy burden of the PPA. The distribution companies like Meralco should face the consequences of their bad business decisions and not pass it on to consumers. The onerous Napocor contracts with the IPP\'s too must be renegotiated for there is no sense paying for power that is not used or even generated.
<P>
The alleged reduction of electricity rates with the passage of the power bill is just creative marketing. We heard of that before when the privatization of MWSS was being pushed. Electricity will not be cheaper but dearer when power generation, transmission and distribution become private monopolies owned by big business.
<P>
The only reason that the administration is hell bent on passing the new power bill is because it is a conditionality for the release of a multimillion dollar loan from the ADB. The power bill is the prime example of how economic policy is not determined by our national interest--meaning the people\'s welfare--but dictated by foreign institutions which are neither accountable nor mandated by the Filipino people. ###

Honorable Dante V. Liban is a man of values and a family man, an exemplary father to his children Jing-Jing, Cheekee, Luzee, Kring-Kring and Carlo. He is a doting and devoted husband to his wife of 26 years, the former Marvina de Leon Reina of La Paz, Iloilo and Talipapa, Novaliches, Quezon City.
<P>
Jing-jing is currently a graduating law student at the University of the Philippines.  Cheekee after obtaining her Child Psychology degree in UP is pursuing her medical studies at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.  Kring-kring is an incoming freshman who will take up Communications Technology Management.  Luzee is a 3rd year high school student while perky Carlo is a 6th grader.
<P>
His wife, fondly called Baby by many has matched Liban’s devotion to his family with equal intensity. She gave up her post as vice president for a multinational firm in Makati City just to be able to devote her time attending to the needs of her family and her husband’s constituents. Now, Congressman and Mrs. Liban are busy devoting their lives answering the needs of the people. The successful tandem of Dante and Baby Liban only proves the truth of the dictum that behind the success of every man is a woman. Liban is also an active Catholic lay leader in Church through his membership in the Couples for Christ. He is a firm believer in the saying: \"No amount of success can ever compensate for failure in the home.\"', '', '', 'liban@pacific.net.ph', '', '932-9990; 428-5015', '0', '20010521155209', '', '', '', '', '61233', '0', 'N', '');

I was born in Manila 45 years ago inside a Hilman car within the Philippine General Hospital compound on March 2, 1956. Papa Sito Sison was driving and Mama Sony Sison was seated at the back seat. Mama Sony said I was in a hurry to be born. When Papa saw my head coming out he parked the car near the Philippine General Hospital gate and rushed inside the hospital to get a doctor. Papa found a nurse who came out of the hospital with a tray to carry all 9 pounds of me. She cut the umbilical cord it was about 4 o\'clock in the morning of March the second.Papa Sito and Mama Sony did their best to bring up 8 children with the guidance of our Lord, with humor, perseverance, and family bonding together with their neighbors and other members of the Christian Family Movement.
<P>
I was fortunate to receive a Jesuit education from Fr. Candelaria, Fr. Galdon, Fr. Ferriols, Fr. Samson, Fr. Hofilena, Fr. Malasmas, Fr. Joe Cruz, Fr. Balchand, Fr. Lahiff, Fr.

Macayan, Ms. Tendero. If I stayed longer than 16 years at the Ateneo de Manila I would have been a priest. Now I am a padre de pamilya, with two gregarious children, one teenager and the other wanting to be a teenager. 
<P>
My parenting style follows a democratic consultative and proactive approach. I do my best to make time for my wife Marge and our children, Ingrid Margaret and Paulo Luis. We listen to each other, we laugh and tell stories and we also pray together. I am a product of my environment, parental guidance, upbringing, and prayer.

<P>
Professor Ed Garcia (A peace advocate and peace arbritator) asked me to assist him and other members of the 1986 Constitutional Commission .They drafted the 1987 Philippine Constitution. I assisted in talking to all the 48 Constitutional Commissioners to include the provisions on the abolition of the death penalty, the nuclear weapons provision and the Commission on Human Rights.

I was born to a family in Tondo, Manila. My father was Alberto Segismundo Cruz, a government employee, poet, novelist and storywriter. He was declared by the government the poet-laureate in 1947, maybe this is the equivalent of a National Artist if given today.

My mother was Patrocinio Lopez Fojas, a professional housewife and part-time homebound businesswoman. It amazes me up to this day how my father and mother with meager resources were able to raise and educate 10 children. Talk about family planning.

<P>
In the Philippines, there seems to be a tendency for many to doubt the capabilities of the youth. Believing that somehow, potential to accomplish great deeds is directly proportional to age. If that were true, then the first representative of CIBAC could not possibly exist. Joel Villanueva, all of 25 years old, has worked hard to make his mark in society. As the current managing director of ZOE TV Channel 11, Joel has been the moving force behind ZOE\'s thrust to provide quality programming for millions of viewers. In addition, he is the chairman of the Kristianong Kabataan Para Bayan (KKB) and the Ministry of HELPS, a socio-civic group providing assistance to calamity victims. He was also a recepient of the Gloria Macapagal Arroyo leadership Award in 1996 as well as a 2-time RP Youth member, representing the country in international basketball competitions. 
<P>
But perhaps his most laudable trait is that he does not find any reason to rest on his laurels. Instead, he has turned his attention towards the people\'s fight against a formidable foe - corruption. Joel is offering his youth and desire to rid the government of this scourge which has been thought by many skeptics as an unsolvable problem. A quixotic spirit in this young man? Perhaps. But that\'s what brought him this far, and would serve him well as the first representative of CIBAC.', '', '', '', '', '0', '20010418102805', '', '', '', '', '0', '0', 'N', '');

Lately, there has been a call to scrutinize media and showbiz candidates running for public office. Many seem to feel that these candidates simply make use of their popularity and their connections with media to catapult them into office without any real capacity to hold it. A skeptic would be quick about dismissing Kim as a CIBAC representative. Pretty, charming and outspoken, she could easily fit stereotypes made to show why media personalities should not be allowed to hold office. At least, on the surface, that is. It takes a closer look to reveal that Kim is actually be one of those who would actually insure a responsive, dynamic system of government that the people deserve. 
<P>
Kim Bernardo Lokin is a dedicated broadcast journalist who has steadfastly upheld her commitment to educate and inform the public on issues of national importance. For nearly a decade, Kim Bernardo-Lokin covered major news events enabling her to be familiar with key branches of government ---- Malacanang, Senate, Department of Justice and the NBI. As senior Senate reporter, Kim anchored ABS-CBN News Channel\'s Senate At Work from 1994-1995, giving the viewers a daily update of activities at the Upper House. 
<P>
In 1996, Kim was tapped to anchor the daily business program \"Stock Market Live\" also at the ABS CBN News Channel (ANC) a post she held for three years before getting her break as a primetime current affairs anchor of \"Moneywise\" a business magazine program which she hosted with Gilbert Remulla.', '', '', '', '', '0', '20010418103020', '', '', '', '', '0', '0', 'N', '');

Some say it is impossible in Philippine politics to find a successful marriage of good, moral values and political acumen in today\'s candidates. If that is true, then CIBAC truly is fortunate. Its third candidate, Atty. Jess Martinez, not only has both, but also manages to get his ideals across in a very down-to-earth and affable manner. He is remarkable in the sense that he has no puffed-up sense of self-importance about him, as many political hopefuls often try to project. His firm handshake and ever-present smile give an impression that he is just another citizen who is willing to serve if given a chance. It is an impression that is nothing but correct. 
<P>
Born in Manila to parents Jesus and Winifred Martinez, Jess has never shown anything but his competence and willingness to serve throughout his life. A lawyer by profession, he has handled many litigation cases for various local and foreign corporations for 15 years. In the political arena, he has been a former board member and later vice-mayor of Negros Oriental, where he served his constituents with the zeal expected of a servant of the public. 
<P>
Jess is also a lay minister of the Community Church of Las Pinas and Fil-American Church in Long Beach, U.S.A. He is married to Cheryl Lynn Jubela-Martinez and they have three children, Michelle Lynn, Monica, and Jesus Gianpaolo III.', '', '', '', '', '0', '20010418103230', '', '', 'Jess', '', '0', '0', 'N', '');

<P>
The youngest of three children of Senator Rodolfo Biazon, Ruffy is not a newcomer in public service. 
<P>
From his birth in Cavite Naval Station to his stay in Fort Bonifacio from less than a year old to his full maturity twenty three years later, he has seen and even been a part of countless civic action missions conducted by his father’s unit in the AFP. With his father’s strong leadership influence, he led similar activities in school, where he was actively involved in organizations and the student council. In the latter years of then General Biazon’s colorful career, Ruffy spent hours discussing with his father the intricacies of politics and public service, driven by the same fervor that characterized his writings in the school newspaper as an editor. 
<P>
After high school, Ruffy dreamt of becoming a doctor with the noble intention of serving the people. As a pre-med course, he entered the University of Santo Tomas in and took up Medical Technology as a pre-med course. But fate had a different story for him. After his four years in UST, his life took a turn towards a different direction, although with the same objective---serving the people. 
<P>
When he got out of college in 1991, he was appointed by then President Corazon Aquino to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Videogram Regulatory Board (VRB) representing the youth. Acting in a similar function as the MTRCB (Movie and Television Ratings and Classification Board), the VRB rates and classifies videogram materials, which are essentially those in video shops and video clubs. 
<P>
When his father, then newly retired Chief of Staff of the AFP, first ran for senator  in 1992, he was appointed as Operations Director of the campaign organization. Although the campaign organization was not well funded and staffed by newcomers in politics, Ruffy was able draw up and implement and effective operations plan. As fate would have it, his father won a seat in the Senate. Immediately after that victory, Ruffy asked to organize the office due to his organizing skills, with the condition that he will continue on the medical school. But the exposure to being able to directly bring public service and the complexity of politics lured him to stay. 
<P>
As Chief of Staff of the Office of Senator Biazon, he practically was the right hand man of the senator. Aside from managing the daily administration of the office, he was also tasked to formulate projects for the Office’s public service programs. He was also the Chief Political Officer, to which he was delegated the task of liaising with other politicians, government agencies and private institutions. More importantly, he supervised the Legislative Staff, the group in the office that dealt with the primary task of a Senator---lawmaking. As such, he was responsible in leading the research and drafting of several important bills of the senator at that time such as the bill mandating the infusion of computer literacy subjects in all public elementary and high schools. 
<P>
In the 1995 elections, Ruffy was designated as Campaign Manager of Senator Biazon for his re-election bid. Although the campaign was effectively and efficiently run, the lack of campaign funds to match those spent by traditional moneyed politicians during the counting allowed Senator Biazon to be victimized by Dagdag-Bawas operators. For Ruffy, it opened an opportunity for him to go to Medical School. 
<P>
But as fate would have it, he was recruited by then newly-elected Senator Sergio Osmeña III to be his Chief Legislative Officer, tasked with heading the group which performed the lawmaking functions of the office. Ruffy used his previous experience to draw up an efficient team which became responsible in supporting Senator Osmeña in his legislative work. Landmark bills such as the Retail Trade Act and Public Services Act marked the output of the team. The investigation into the questionable Marconi Radar Contract was one of the important works of the team led by Ruffy which resulted into the cancellation of the contract. Another was the investigation into the series of sea tragedies which revealed the anomalies being done in the maritime agencies in the government. 
<P>
To prepare for Senator Biazon’s bid to return to the Senate in 1998, Ruffy resigned from the Office of Senator Osmeña in 1997 and prepared the groundwork for the campaign. Drawing on his organizing skills, political acumen and previous experience, Ruffy as Campaign Manager successfully steered the campaign of Senator Biazon to victory. 
<P>
Once again, Ruffy occupies the position of Chief of Staff of a senator’s office. More seasoned and mature this time around, he has taken on his role with much gusto. Once again, he has led the legislative staff of Senator Biazon to perform beyond the senator’s expectations. Effective management of human and material resources has brought about an effective and efficient office, with outputs surpassing those of other senators. 
<P>
In July of 2000, the Philippines played host to the 3rd Conference of the Global Parliamentarians on Habitat, an organization of parliamentarians and legislators from all over the world. Ruffy’s experience and skill in logistics management was once more tapped when he was appointed Director for Administration and Logistics of the conference secretariat. Without a hitch, the conference was conducted successfully, with more than 300 representatives from more than a hundred countries attending.  
<P>
But the most important contribution of Ruffy to the senator’s office are the innovations and public service programs he has initiated. Being an avid information technology hobbyist (he is proficient in webpage design, computer graphics and multimedia applications), he has introduced computerization into the senator’s office making it one of the best equipped offices in the senate. He also provides the senator with insight on information technology, enabling the Senator to formulate proposals in the field of computerization. 
<P>
Being a resident of Muntinlupa, Ruffy formulated Compu.T.E.R.S. Project (Computer Training for Educators and Resources for Students Project) in Muntinlupa schools. Upon the recommendation of Ruffy, an initial amount of Three Million Pesos from Senator Biazon’s CDF was released for the purchase of computers for Muntinlupa National High School and Pedro E. Diaz High School and software training for the teachers. A second allocation amounting to Ten Million Pesos was released for the Compu.T.E.R.S. Project which would provide computers to all the four public high schools and fifteen public elementary schools plus software training for 740 public school teachers. Ruffy has also implemented an Internet Use Seminar for the students and teachers of Pedro Diaz High School, in preparation for the next project, the Internet Connection Project for high schools. 
<P>
Having gone around the country since 1992 delivering services in behalf of the senator, Ruffy has chosen to concentrate on the City of Muntinlupa. With his active participation in the legislative process since 1992, is knowledgeable about a wide range of issues, particularly those about information technology, education, public order and security, national defense, urban development and housing. 
<P>
His exposure in the Committee on Housing, Urban Planning and Resettlement which Senator Biazon chairs has given rise to his concern for those in the urban poor sector, particularly in Muntinlupa. He has formed MRB, Muntinlupa para sa Reproma at Bayanihan, a group that immerses itself in the urban poor communities of Muntinlupa and other sectors like the youth and the women, to get first hand information about the prevailing issues in those sectors to come up with legislative proposals that meet their needs. In addition, MRB has conducted numerous regular public service projects such as medical missions, water supply and support to activities of youth and community organizations. 
<P>
He has also initiated the “I Care for Day Care Project” of the Office of Senator Biazon, which benefits all 46 day care centers under the supervision of Muntinlupa Social Welfare Department. 
<P>
In his personal capacity, he is a director in ZONTAR Manpower Agency and Black Stallion Security Agency, both of which he is one of the incorporators.', '', 'ruffy@ruffybiazon.com', '8093132', '0919-2015658', '0', '20010418130436', '', '', 'Ruffy', '', '0', '0', 'N', '');

Who is Boy Seseng de los Angeles?
<P>
Celso Gancayco de los Angeles<BR>
“Boy Seseng”<BR>
Date of birth: August 6, 1952<BR>
Address: 206 J.P. Rizal St., Sta. Elena, Marikina City<BR>
Married to: Concepcion Arguelles Panlilio<BR>
Children: Martin Nicolo P. de los Angeles<BR>
Paolo Vicente P. de los Angeles  <BR>
<P>
Celso Gancayco de los Angeles, Jr. also known as “Boy Seseng” is the great grandson of the founder of the Shoe Industry, Laureano “Kapitan Moy” Guevara. He is a native Marikeno. His father, the late Dr. Celso Guevara de los Angeles or “Dr. Seseng” was a very much-loved physician in Marikina. He was one of the internationally well respected authorities in the field of pulmonary medicine. In Marikina, he was often referred to as “Doktor ng Bayan”. The mother of Boy Seseng is Purita Gancayco de los Angeles. She is still very active in the Catholic Women’s League, where she was the former National Director. She is also a trustee of the Sandigan Foundation. Boy Seseng’s grandfather on his father’s side, the late Don Servando Manahan de los Angeles ran for Congress in the 2nd district of the Province of Rizal.
<P>
Mr. Celso G. de los Angeles, Jr., more popular known as “Boy Seseng” hailed from Marikina, the shoe capital of the Philippines. His Father, a dedicated physician was fondly called by his patients and friends as Dr. Seseng and his mother, Purita Gancayco de los Angeles who isstill living at their family house where he grew up in Brgy. Sta. Elena is known in the neighborhood as Dona Purita. The desire of his loving parents to provide him a better life in the future sent him to an exclusive school, Ateneo de Manila University where he completed his education from grade school to college. He pursued his studies and took up his Masters in Business Administration at the Asian Institute of Management, the country’s premier school in Management.
<P>
Boy Seseng has also his ups and downs but he believes that there is an opportunity in every crisis. He realized how much more persons can do it if they go beyond what appears to be their limits. “If you dreamed the best for yourself, you usually get,” as he often emphasized to his employees. His experiences in the USA for almost 14 years where he was even forced to apply as a security guard and as a gasoline attendant served as an inspiration and encouragement for his work force. And while working, he took time to study and finish a course in Free Legal Administration Management at Georgetown University in Washinton D.C.
<P>
In 1996, when Mr. Celso G. de los Angeles, Jr. returned to the Philippines, he was welcomed by an offer to venture in the pre-need business and joined a fast growing educational plan company, Scholarship Plan Philippines Inc., as Chairman and CEO. Although he did not know the industry very well, he considered it as a challenge, and his financial expertise had gained him a firm base in this new endeavor. However, he realized that a one-product company does not only limit its market share but the profit margin as well and on December 5, 1998 Celso G. de los Angeles, Jr. acquired Legacy Plans Inc., as majority owner and launched the most competitive pension plan in the market.
<P>
As a banker and a businessman, Mr. Celso G. de los Angeles, Jr., inspired by his great grandfather, Don Laureano “Kapitan Moy” Guevarra who set up the first shoe industry, has a special concern for the shoe industry and putting up a Marikina Shoe bank partly owned by shoe manufacturers and partly owned by the government is his most cherished dream. He stressed that shoemakers in Marikina if given the right support can craft shoes and accessories that could compete in the fashion centers of Paris, London, New Yorkm and Tokyo and even penetarate the global market.
<P>
His outstanding performance attained through the years will serve as benchmarks for greater achievements ahead. His innovative management, pioneering efforts and the commitment to the business will surely lead to futher improve performance, set higher standards and enhance human resources capability particularly in the fields of marketing to face greater challenges and set the tone for the next millennium.', 'Marikina City', 'bosesnatin@hotmail.com', '', '6461575', '2', '20010508105210', '', '', 'Boy Seseng', '', '0', '0', 'N', '');

<LI>After two years of implementation of the AFMA, the government managed to 
reverse the fast-declining farm productivity that had hobbled previous

highest in 20 years. </LI></UL></UL>

<LI>Angara also fought for fair trading rules in a free trade environment. In

<P align=justify>Educator, legislator, banker, lawyer, art patron and farmer and 
former Executive Secretary and Secretary of Agriculture. Edgardo J. Angara is 
indeed a man of many facets and pursuits. In all of these preoccupations, Angara 
has stood out and made his mark.</P>
<P align=justify>Born to middle-class parents in Baler, Aurora, Angara scaled up 
the ladder of corporate law, the academe of politics to emerge as one of the 
country’s top public leaders and intellectuals.</P>
<P align=justify>A product of the University of the Philippines (Bachelor of 
Laws, 1958), and the University of Michigan (Master of Laws, 1964), he founded 
in the early seventies what eventually became one of the country’s most 
prestigious law firms – the Angara, Concepcion, Cruz, Regala and Abello (ACCRA) 
Law Offices.</P>
<P align=justify>He gained prominence during his stint as the Presidentof the 
University of the Philippines from 1981 to 1987. During the turbulent years of 
his stewardship at UP, he defended not only the State University’s tradition of 
dissent but also significantly improved its financial and human resources, Under 
his term, UP established stronger links with the business community and alumni 
organizations, both locally and abroad.</P>
<P align=justify>His achievements as UP President and active involvement in the 
Citizens watchdog group NAMFREL during the 1986 \"snap elections\" pushed him to 
national prominence and mainstream politics. He placed 5<SUP>th</SUP> in the 
senatorial election in 1987, the first free election after martial law.</P>
<P align=justify>He was named \"No. 1 Senator\" of the 8<SUP>th</SUP> Congress by 
the UP Institute of Strategic Development Studies. He was 3<SUP>rd</SUP> in the 
1992 senatorial elections and from 1993 to 1995, he served as Senate 
President.</P>
<P align=justify>During Angara’s term as Senate President, the chamber was an 
activist, reformist institution. He pushed hard for the passage of over 100 laws 
that turned around the economy and laid down the environment for economic 
dynamism and growth. A new Philippine Central Bank was created, the banking 
system was liberalized, and infrastructure build up boosted the economy with the 
massive entry of foreign investments.</P>
<P align=justify>Also during his term as Senate President, Angara’s reformist 
bent was the sheer force that cut through the legislative gridlock to pass 
landmark legislation.</P>
<P align=justify>As a legislator, he was identified with landmark laws in 
education, health, the arts , culture, and agriculture. He had a special concern 
for the underclass, He was the principal author of the law granting free high 
school education to all Filipinos. He authored the Magna Carta for Public Health 
Workers. He also headed the congressional commission that turned out a landmark 
comprehensive report on Philippine education. The report was the basis for the 
restructuring of the education department and the on-going major reforms in the 
educational system.</P>
<P align=justify>Two laws sponsored by Angara created the Commission on Higher 
Education and Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and this 
enabled the education department to focus on its main concern – basic 
education.</P>
<P align=justify>He also sponsored the passage of the Agriculture, Fisheries and 
Modernization Act which mandates the allocation of 120 billion pesos for the 
modernization of the agricultural sector for a period of seven years.</P>
<P align=justify>For those in the margin, Angara authored the Senior Citizens 
Act and the Breast Feeding Act. He co-authored the landmark Generics Drug Act 
and authored the law that provided a National Insurance Program for Filipinos 
(PhilHealth).</P>
<P align=justify>A committed patron of the arts, he was the principal sponsor of 
a law that created the new National Museum. A law he sponsored created the 
National Commission on Culture and the Arts. The law on National Living 
Treasures bestows great honor on traditional and folk artists.</P>
<P align=justify>As Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Angara had 
been the chief steward in increasing production, expanding markets, correcting 
policy biases and promoting the cause of agriculture and fisheries.</P>
<P align=justify>Frontier research work in agriculture research and development 
had been another hallmark of Angara’s leadership at the DA. The great strides 
recently achieved by the sector had been largely attributed to his 
leadership.</P>
<P align=justify>Angara also became a solid voice in the fight for fair trading 
rules in global trade. He coined the phrase \"fair trade in a free trade context\" 
to dramatize the resolve of the developing countries to end the protectionist 
and unfair trade policies of developed countries. His bargaining with Australia 
over the entry of world-class fruits to that country’s market had been widely 
hailed in the country’s farming and trade circles.</P>
<P align=justify>From a negative 6.6 percent performance in 1998, the 
agriculture sector had registered solid growths during the one year and a half 
Angara was secretary. The growth rate for the year 2000 was 3 percent. Palay 
production, according to field reports, was expected at 12.5 million metric 
tons, a historic record. The drive to gain self-sufficiency in rice, an elusive 
goal, is about to become a reality, thanks to the production programs and 
support services initiated under his stewardship of the agriculture 
department.</P>
<P align=justify>In 1999, the sector posted a growth rate of 6.7 percent.</P>
<P align=justify>The sector is expected to register a decent growth rate for the 
current year.</P>
<P align=justify>Having taken his oath on January 6, 2001 as Executive Secretary 
he was responsible for the peaceful transition of the presidency from Estrada to 
Arroyo, and the peaceful transition of power would not have been possible were 
it not for Angara and his unwavering commitment to serve his country until the 
very end.</P>
<P align=justify>Before joining the Estrada cabinet on May 25, 1999, he served 
as Chairman of the Philippine National Bank.</P>
<P align=justify>He is married to Gloria Manalang, who was former chair of the 
Cultural Center of the Philippines.

ng mga mangagawa ay nakabatay na sa buwanang kita ng kumpanya. Kailangan din na 
tiyakin muna ng pamahalaan, tulad ng DTI na lugi na ang kumpanya at kailangan 
din na maging transparent ang mga kumpanyang ito. Pero para maging globally

<P>
Senator Santiago exposed the graft and corruption in the Department of Interior 
and Local Government and sought Senate blue ribbon committee probes on the 
string of anomalous government contracts entered into by DILG secretary Ronaldo 
Puno, namely: 
<P>1.  the P3.6 billion Mahogany drug-test deal; <BR>2.  the P307 
million handcuffs deal with Pelaez Enterprises; <BR>3.  the P1 billion LAMP 
contract; <BR>4.  the P19.4 billion budget scam; <BR>5.  the creation 
of the PNP Special Operation Force; and, <BR>6.  the P40 million DILG 
information campaign. 
<P> The Senate blue ribbon committee later recommended the filing of graft 
charges against Puno.  A government-commissioned investigation also pointed 
to Puno as the perpetrator of a series of  corrupt activities which 
crippled the coffers of the national government.  Again, if not for Sen. 
MDS, these anomalies would have gone unnoticed. 
<P>· Senator Santiago launched her Code Annotated Series Project 2000 which is 
intended to update legal knowledge for the 21st century. She annotated with the 
latest Supreme Court decisions, all the major legal codes in the country.  
The three new law books launched in mid-year were Constitution Annotated, Rules 
of Court Annotated and Penal Code Annotated.  The books immediately hit the 
bestsellers’ list.  Santiago later launched in December two more law books 
as part of the series, namely Civil Code Annotated and Local Government Code 
Annotated. 
<P>· Senator Santiago launched her International Law (with Philippine Cases and 
Materials and ASEAN Instruments).  Santiago resided at Cambridge 
University, as a 1999 Visiting Fellow of the Lauterpacht Research Center for 
International Law last summer where she was inspired at top speed to write her 
treatise on international law. 
<P>· Senator Santiago delivered a privilege speech analyzing the criminal 
liability of Ramos and five of his cabinet secretaries for authorizing the 
release of P7 billion to propagandize the centennial celebrations.  
Santiago said the “smoking gun” in the proposed criminal case against former 
president Fidel Ramos is the memorandum dated 27 February 1997 where Ramos 
directed the executive departments to support from their 1997 budgets the 
centennial celebration project.  She charged that Ramos failed to comply 
with the two conditions allowed by the Constitution for the transfer of 
appropriations, namely it should only be an augmentation and it should come from 
savings.  The Senate blue ribbon committee later released its report 
finding Ramos and his cabinet secretaries liable for graft. The ex-president 
suffered another crushing blow when the committee headed by Senator Rene 
Saguisag also found him guilty of graft. Santiago was instrumental in ensuring 
that the highest public office will always be a public trust. 
<P>· Senator Santiago publicly disclosed the alleged practice of big-time casino 
VIPs of getting multi-million loans in state-owned casinos run by Pagcor which 
enables them to continue gambling even after they have lost all their 
cash.  Santiago said that the government may have lost from P400 to P1 
billion, because of bouncing checks issued by casino VIPs.  She stressed 
that credit lines which remain unpaid for extended periods of time represent 
substantial revenue losses for the government. 
<P>· Senator Santiago introduced the country’s first and only legislative 
training program called Summer sa Senado.  The program is designed to teach 
the youth about legislation and gave them a hands-on training on drafting bills 
and resolutions.  Students from the country’s top universities participated 
in the program and penned their own bills on different topics such as consumer 
rights, environment protection, and children’s rights.  Santiago empowered 
the youth by sponsoring the interns’ original bills in the Senate. 
<P>· Senator Santiago called for the speedy passage of her bill, “Code of 
Professional Standards for Political Public Relations,” that seeks to 
professionalize the practice of political public relations and penalize bribery 
of media members in order to obtain preferential or guaranteed news or editorial 
coverage. 
<P>· Senator Santiago voted for the Visiting Forces Agreement.  Santiago 
called the VFA a “necessary imposition,” saying the Philippines needs to make a 
choice between the US and Japan on the one hand, or China on the other 
hand.  She said the Philippines should remain an ally of the US, because 
the US “remains at the helm of the strongest network of military alliances in 
the Asia-Pacific.” 
<P>· Senator Santiago delivered a statement at the United Nations General 
Assembly in Vienna, Austria, calling on the international community to consider 
the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand 
Reduction as a potent measure against drug manufacturing and trafficking. 
<P>· Senator Santiago interceded with the DOTC secretary to re-open the Iloilo 
City Airport in time with the Dinagyang Festival scheduled for January 17 to 24, 
1999.  Santiago urged the DOTC to speed up the maintenance work and repairs 
needed for the airport runway. 
<P>· Filed the most number of bills and resolutions in the Senate, 
with   bills and   resolutions.  Delivered 12 privilege 
speeches:  Media Corruption in the National Elections, The Charter Change 
is Unconstitutional, The Proposed VFA is Void Ab Initio Because the Basis is 
Unconstitutional, A Congress Member has the Right to Resign, Taxpayer’s 
Statement of Assets and Liabilities well-intention, But..., The Constitution 
Does Not Protect the Speech of Hate, Presidential Liability for P7 B Fund 
Juggling, The VFA in Constitutional and International Law, The VFA in the Law of 
Belligerency, The VFA in Contemporary International Relations, The P3.6 B Police 
Drug Test Deal is Grossly Disadvantageous to the Government, The Kingdom of 
Darkness, or the Empire that Government Contracts Built. 
<P>· Senator Santiago met 365 tricycle drivers of Philcoa in Quezon City where 
she distributed sacks of rice as part of her outreach program. <BR>

<P>“The only thing we are not importing is politicians, because that is what we 
have in abundance.” <BR>---Senator Santiago, lamenting that the country is 
importing almost everything from rice, corn, pork, and poultry to fruits and 
fishery products, except politicians 
<P>“They have the rapacity of a crocodile and they have the epidermis of a 
pachyderm.” <BR>---Senator Santiago, saying the administration was producing 
“new hybrid life forms” which she described as half-elephant, half-crocodile 
<P>“I fear very much that we are developing a cabinet of kleptocracy.” 
<BR>---Senator Santiago, pointing out that “world-class larceny” was what was 
taking place in the administration 
<P>“I have only sympathy for the President.” <BR>---Senator Santiago, assailing 
corruption in the Cabinet <BR>  
<P><B><FONT size=+1> WHAT MEDIA SAID OF MIRIAM...</FONT></B> 
<P> “Miriam has revived the glory days of the Senate as the watchdog of 
administration venalities.” <BR> “Miriam has also shown in the Puno exposes 
that she is not a Estrada stooge...In exposing Puno, Miriam has rediscovered the 
power of inquiry of the Senate and has become the symbol of this rediscovery at 
a time when the legislature is so intimidated by the President’s popularity that 
it does not stand up to him.” <BR> “Miriam has found her mark---as catalyst 
of the reassertion by the Senate of its function as a chamber of inquiry into 
administration venalities.” <BR>      ---Amando 
Doronila, Inquirer <BR>          
“Miriam finds her mark” 
<P> “Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago is one colorful personality.  I 
like her.  She has one of the widest, and lately most vivid vocabularies 
among our public figures.  I was impressed by Santiago’s use of the English 
language during the 1998 presidential campaign.  She was easily the most 
articulate among the candidates.” <BR>      ---Leandro

<P align=left><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>BORN on 
November 28, 1945 in Iloilo City, Franklin M. Drilon is the eldest of four 
children of Primitiva Drilon and the late Cesar M. Drilon, Sr. A product of the 
public schools, he finished his elementary education in Baluarte Elementary 
School in Molo, Iloilo City in 1957; high school in UP Iloilo College in 1961, 
and received Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees from the University 
of the Philippines (UP) in 1965 and 1969, respectively. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>In UP, he did not 
only excel in academics; he was a student leader. He was elected University 
Councilor of the Student Council; served as associate editor of the Philippine 
Collegian, the country’s premier campus paper; member of the Editorial Board of 
the prestigious Philippine Law Journal; member of the Order of the Purple 
Feather, the honor society of the U.P. College of Law; and member of the Sigma 
Rho Fraternity.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>A brilliant legal 
mind, he placed third in the 1969 Bar Exams. After passing the Bar Examinations, 
he joined the Sycip, Salazar, Luna, Manalo &amp; Feliciano Law Offices. In 1974, 
he started his career with the Angara, Abello, Concepcion, Regala &amp; Cruz 
(ACCRA) Law Offices as senior associate, rose from the ranks to become a 
partner, co-managing partner and finally as managing partner and head of the 
said law firm on August 11, 1986. He resigned in September 1986 leaving the 
lucrative practice of law to join the government of President Aquino as Deputy 
Minister of Labor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Drilon served as 
Secretary of Labor from January 1987 to January 1990; Secretary of Justice (DOJ) 
from January 1990 to July 1991; Executive Secretary from July 1991 to June 1992; 
again, Secretary of DOJ from July 1992 to February 1995. He had served in the 
Cabinet of two Presidents--Corazon Aquino and Fidel V. Ramos. He served in the 
governing boards and councils of various government corporations and 
institutions, such as being Chairman of the Philippine National Bank; member of 
the board of Directors of Land Bank and Philippine Airlines; Chairman of the 
Presidential Committee on Human Rights and the Cabinet Cluster “E” on Political 
and Security matters; Chairman of the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency and 
Overseas Worker Welfare Administration; Vice-Chairman, Judicial and Bar 
Council.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>During the 1995 
Senatorial campaign, Drilon ran on the slogan “Kontra sa Krimen, Justice Agad”, 
a reminder of how, as Justice Secretary, he spearheaded the crusade to bring to 
the bar of justice the seemingly high and mighty -- the likes of Calauan, Laguna 
Mayor Antonio Sanchez, Claudio Teehankee, Jr., and Rolito Go. He promised the 
people that, when elected, he will introduce legislation to improve the justice 
system. The people believed in his cause, and elected him Senator, placing 4th. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>He kept his 
promise. Thus, immediately after his election as Senator, Drilon filed various 
measures designed to speed up the trial of cases in the courts, strengthen the 
free legal services to the poor, and declog court dockets by prescribing 
arbitration rules and procedures on commercial disputes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>A few months after 
the resumption of the 10th Congress, Senator Drilon was immediately recognized 
as one of the foremost legal minds in the Senate when it comes to deliberations 
in committee hearings and on the Senate Floor. For his outstanding performance 
in his first year in the Senate, Drilon was voted by the Senate press corps as 
the “Most Promising” among the neophyte Senators. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>He did not only 
concentrate on the country’s justice system. He also drafted and filed bills for 
the benefit of the working class; on banking; on housing; on electoral reforms, 
to name a few. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>In the 10th 
Congress (1995-1998), Senator Drilon was chairman of Senate Committees on 
Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations (Blue Ribbon); Banks, 
Financial Institutions and Currencies; Finance Committee Sub-Committee VI and 
Agricultural Commission (Agricom) Sub-Committee on Productions and Support 
Services. He was vice-chairman of Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights 
and a member of 20 other Senate committees. He was also Member of the powerful 
Commission on Appointments. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>In the present 11th 
Congress, Drilon serves as the Majority Floor Leader, Chairman of the Committee 
on Rules and Committee on Accounts, and ex-officio member of all Senate standing 
committees. He continues to serve as member of the Commission on Appointments. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>In professional and 
civic organizations, Drilon was a Bar Examiner on Labor and Social Legislation 
in 1979 and 1984; a member of the Makati Rotary Club; past Chapter president of 
the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP); past governor of the Employers 
Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) and past vice-president of the Personnel 
Management Association of the Philippines (PMAP).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>A former member of 
the National Unification Commission (NUC), Senator Drilon now sits as adviser to 
the government panel in the Government of the Republic of the 
Philippines-National Democratic Front/Communist Party of the Philippines/New 
People’s Army (GRP-NDF/CPP/NPA) peace talks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Drilon is a 
recipient of the much coveted award of the Philippine Legion of Honor and a 
Presidential citation for outstanding public service. He was named the Most 
Outstanding UP Alumnus in government service for 1994 by the UP Law Alumni 
Association. He was conferred the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, by 
the Central Philippine University.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>He is also a sports 
enthusiast. He jogs a lot to stay physically fit and ready for any challenge 
that he may have to take in some future time. When not reading books, mainly 
non-fiction, or listening to his favorite songs, he tends to the orchid gardens 
his loving wife left behind. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Drilon was married

Concurrently, he held the chairmanship of the Monetary Board and acted as the 
Insurance Commissioner and Commissioner of Customs. He went on to occupy more 
key positions in the government including the Department of Justice and 
Department of National Defense. His seventeen-year stint in the Defense 
Department was highlighted by his withdrawal of support for the twenty-year old 
government of President Ferdinand Marcos, which led to the revolt that triggered 
the historical People Power or EDSA Revolution. <BR><BR>

<B>FRUITFUL SENATORIAL STINT</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
Excellence undoubtedly marked his stay in the government while serving in 
various capacities. In 1987, he was the lone opposition Senator and thus 
provided a constructive minority by being an effective fiscalizer to the new 
Aquino government. In 1992, he won a seat in the House of Representatives by a 
landslide representing the First District of Cagayan, his home province. He went 
back to the Senate in 1995 and chaired two powerful committees namely, 
Government Corporations and Public Enterprises, and Ways and Means. <BR><BR>As 
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, he spearheaded the enactment 
of laws, which promote economic reforms by generating more income for the 
government. In crafting these legislative measures, he stressed the importance 
of a simplified tax system so as not to make taxation more burdensome and 
onerous for the taxpaying public as well as promote efficiency in revenue 
collection. To achieve this, he authored the following bills: 
<UL>
<LI><B>Republic Act 8424 - Comprehensive Tax Reform Program</B> <BR><BR>SALIENT

<LI>Exemption from tax of all income earned abroad by an Overseas Filipino

family home provided that said proceeds will utilized to acquire another 
residential home.

Government Corporations and Public Enterprises, he has exposed certain 
irregularities in the government, which led to a string of graft charges against 
the culprit involved. Incisive legislative inquiries and well-documented public 
hearings were concluded in order to shed light on the following controversial 
issues: PEA-Amari Land Scam, Tax Credit Scam in the DOF and Purchase of Luxury 
Vehicles by DECS Officials. <BR><BR>

<B>AS A SENATOR-JUDGE</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
His fruitful stint in the Senate was marked with a genuine desire to serve the 
public. This was again proven during the much-publicized impeachment trial of 
President Joseph Ejercito Estrada. As one of the Senator-Judges, the public 
marveled at Senator Enrile\'s admirable display of legal expertise. As a lawyer 
who has not lost a single case when he practiced law after passing the bar with 
a perfect score in Commercial Law, he dutifully performed the gargantuan task of 
rendering impartial justice during the impeachment trial. His strong 
determination to uphold the Constitution earned him the sternest of rebuke from 
some sectors that misunderstood the sincerity of his stand. <BR><BR>Every inch a 
seasoned statesman, Senator Enrile managed to regain the confidence of the 
people when they realized the candor and honesty of his intentions. In the 
recent SWS Survey, he landed in the magic 12, a feat that was elusive even to 
those who figured prominently during the impeachment trial by joining the 
bandwagon. <BR><BR>This coming election, the public will again bear witness to 
an active demonstration of how democracy operates in the country by putting in 
power to only those candidates with proven competence, integrity and genuine 
desire to serve the Filipino people. One such man is SENATOR JUAN PONCE ENRILE, 
who stood up not only like a man, but also as an honorable statesman. <BR>', '', '', '', '[Source: <A HREF=\"http://www.juanponceenrile.com/profile-english.html\">http://www.juanponceenrile.com/profile-english.html</A>]<BR><BR>
<P>
One such man grew up poor and out of wedlock and continues to influence world 
events. His EDSA led revolt became a model for toppling repressive regimes all 
over the world. <BR><BR>Juan Ponce Enrile was born on Valentine\'s Day in a 
remote village in Cagayan. He was christened Juanito Furagganan, taking his 
mother\'s name. <BR><BR>Looking for better opportunities, the young Juanito left 
Gonzaga, Cagayan for the poblacion and enrolled in school by working as a 
servant to his mother\'s relative. <BR><BR>He later transferred to Aparri and 
enrolled at the Cagayan Valley Institute. <BR><BR>World War II broke out and 
Juanito, now a young man joined the guerillas. He was caught, imprisoned and 
tortured. He escaped, and at the end of the war, was serving in the U.S. 
Quartermaster depot in Aparri, Cagayan. <BR><BR>While the war was raging, his 
half sisters evacuated to Aparri and learned about Juanito. <BR><BR>After the 
war, Juanito met his father in the latter\'s Law Office in Binondo, Manila. 
<BR><BR>Don Alfonso brought Juanito home to Malabon. He was given a new name, 
Juan Ponce Enrile. He resumed his High School education at the St. James Academy 
in Malabon. <BR><BR>In 1947, he entered Ateneo de Manila graduating cum laude 
with an Associate in Arts Degree. In the UP, he graduated cum laude and 
salutatorian of UP Law Class 1953. He later passed the Bar Examinations placing 
11th with a 91.72% rating and getting a perfect score in commercial law. 
<BR><BR>He was offered a scholarship by the Harvard University where he earned a 
Master of Laws degree specializing in taxation and corporate reorganization. 
<BR><BR>Returning to the Philippines, he joined the Ponce Enrile, Siguion Reyna, 
Montecillo, Bello Law Office where he emerged as a top corporate and litigation 
lawyer. He never lost a case. <BR><BR>In 1966, he was appointed as 
Undersecretary of Finance, acting Insurance Commissioner of Customs and acting 
Chairman of the Monetary Board. In 1968-70 he served as Secretary of Justice. He 
was appointed Secretary of National Defense in 1970, a position he held for 
almost seventeen (17) years until 1986. <BR><BR>He became an Assemblyman of 
Cagayan in 1978 and was reelected in 1984. <BR><BR>The events of February 1986 
marked turning point in the history of the Philippines and in Enrile\'s career. 
Following the turbulent snap elections of February 7,1986, and amid the 
prolonged crisis that gripped the country after the assassination of former 
Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr., Enrile withdrew his support for the Marcos 
government and led the revolt that triggered what would be known as the People 
Power or EDSA Revolution. <BR><BR>Together with a handful of officers and men, 
he rallied the ranks of the Philippine military behind the rebellion, which 
culminated in the fall of the Marcos government. <BR><BR>It was during this time 
that hundreds of thousands of citizens poured into EDSA (Epifanio Delos Santos 
Avenue) and for four days surrounded the camp where Enrile and his men were 
holding out, thus averting a bloody confrontation between the rebels and Marcos 
loyalist group in the military. <BR><BR>Mrs. Corazon Aquino, who was proclaimed 
the New President, reappointed Enrile as Secretary of National Defense. He the 
post after six months, however, as differences over policy with the new 
administration grew. <BR><BR>In 1987, he ran and won as opposition Senator. 
Subsequently, was the lone opposition Senator in the Senate. As Minority Floor 
Leader, he was a member of all the standing committees of the Senate. He was 
also a member of the Senate Electoral Tribunal and the Commission on 
Appointments. <BR><BR>In the May 11, 1992 elections, he won a seat in the House 
of Representatives by a landslide representing the First District of Cagayan, 
his home province. He joined the Liberal Party, to which his father belonged, 
shortly after. <BR><BR>In the May 1995 elections he ran and won a seat once 
again in the Senate under the Lakas Coalition. Again he was a member of the 
Commission on Appointments and Chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee 
and the Committee on Government Corporations and Public Enterprises. <BR><BR>At 
that time, he authored the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program, which eventually 
became Republic Act 8424. Among the inclusions that would greatly benefit the 
Overseas Filipino Worker in this law is the exemption of their income earned 
abroad from taxation, thus enabling them to save a more substantial amount from 
their salaries for their families. In addition to this, is the exemption from 
capital gains tax, proceeds realized from the sale of one\'s family home provided 
that such gains would be utilized to acquire another residential home. 
<BR><BR>During the 10th and 11th Congress, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile filed 
several legislative landmarks namely: the; SB No. 2068 which seeks to increase 
by at least 100% the personal and additional tax exemptions granted to 
individual income tax payers; SB. No. 2089 which seeks to reduce the income tax 
rates on taxable income; SB 1887 which would allow the deductibility from 
taxable income of interest payments on housing loans, and in addition, SB No. 
2082 which seeks to exempt all the allowances and benefits granted to public 
school teachers, including those in state colleges and universities from income 
tax. <BR><BR>He has gone on to serve as one of the most productive and 
outstanding senators in the present Congress. <BR><BR>He has continued to serve 
as he has lived- with excellence, determination and desire to serve the Filipino 
people. <BR>', 'Gonzaga, Cagayan', '', '', '', '2', '20010623104303', '', '[Source: <A HREF=\"http://www.juanponceenrile.com/legislative-agenda.html\">http://www.juanponceenrile.com/legislative-agenda.html</A>]<BR><BR>
<P>
I consider the following as the top priorities for the nation included in my 
legislative agenda as Senator of the Philippines should I be fortunate enough to 
be re-elected as Senator this coming elections: <BR><BR><B>THE ECONOMY</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
We have to calibrate carefully the exchange rate so that we neither price 
ourselves out of the world market nor allow the peso to depreciate. An 
acceptable exchange rate must be determined in relation to our neighbors and our 
competitors. With respect to interest rates, I advocate the policy of fostering 
competition - not regulation - to bring down interest rate levels. I will 
directly compete with the commercial banks by providing credit lower rates. 
<BR><BR>I have long ago taken the position that we must reduce the tax burden on 
the people. Primarily, I am advocating this as a creative way of increasing the 
free or disposable income of taxpayers and spurring economic activity. 
<BR><BR>We must realize that no matter how much we press for salary increases, 
employers are hardly in a position, especially given the economic situation, to 
give their employees the substantial wage increase they need to cope with the 
rise in cost of living. A cut in taxes will automatically increase the take home 
pay of our salaried employees and thus enable them to buy more goods. The 
economy will benefit in turn from increased spending and economic activity. 
<BR><BR>During the last Congress, I filed two related bills aimed at achieving 
this goal to wit, Senate Bill No. 2068 which seeks to increase the allowable 
personal and addition exemptions of individual taxpayers by at least 100%; and 
Senate Bill No. 2089 aimed at reducing the corresponding tax rates of individual 
taxpayers by at least 50%. Public hearings for the passage of this bill were 
held and the corresponding Committee Reports were prepared. I even went to the 
extent of sponsoring it in the Senate before we adjourned. <BR><BR>Moreover, to 
further protect the consuming public from the predatory practices of some 
unscrupulous businessmen, I will pursue the enactment of an Anti-Trust Law that 
will check and penalize any act or practice that will in one way or the other 
result in any combination or monopoly in restraint of trade. <BR><BR>If 
re-elected, I vow to pursue these and other measures aimed at reducing the tax 
burden on the people so that they can have more money in their hands for their 
basic needs. <BR><BR><B>PEACE AND ORDER</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
I advocate the return of jurisdiction and control over the police to the local 
governments. Nationalizing the police has only turned the law enforcement effort 
into a bureaucratic mess. We should maintain a national constabulary at a 
national level to attend to peace and order problems that are national in 
nature. <BR><BR><B>GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
I advocate the following: 
<UL>
<LI>Adoption of the generalized civil service system of the British Civil 
Service, in lieu of our present compartmentalized system. Under that system, a 
civil servant is considered as an employee of the entire government service not 
of specific departments or agencies. Thus, he or she can be easily moved from 
one department to another. 
<LI>Review of the entire government bureau so as to remove duplication of 
agencies and services to make the government not only less wasteful but more 
efficient as well. 
<LI>Restoration of the full powers of the Commission on Appointments of Congress 
under which all officials of the bureaucracy down to assistant director level 
must pass the scrutiny of the Commission. This will help arrest profusion of 
political appointments to the civil service. 
<LI>Abolition of the Judicial and Bar Council, which at present recommends to 
the President appointments to the courts. </LI></UL><B>EDUCATION</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
To achieve high-quality education, we should focus attention on the three areas 
where reform can result in positive change for our society: 
<UL>
<LI>The quality of teachers and teacher training; 
<LI>The physical facilities of our institutions of learning; and 
<LI>The substance of the curriculum. </LI></UL>During the past Congress, I filed 
several Senate Bills that will boost our education system into the new 
millennium. An example of which concentrates on information technology (IT) 
education since the IT industry is the wave of the future. Another bill proposes 
to exempt the allowances granted to public school teachers from taxation to 
entice more people to join the academe. <BR><BR>We must also create more State 
Colleges and Universities so that more Filipino students may be given the 
opportunity to enroll at a low cost. <BR><BR>If re-elected, I shall continue to 
pursue my vision for Education by re-filing these bills, file other related 
measures and work on the passage of the same. <BR><BR><B>NATIONAL SECURITY</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
I wholly support the modernization of our armed forces. What we need are modern 
weapon systems. Because we do not have all the available resources for full AFP 
modernization, we should set priorities. Between the Navy and the Air Force, I 
believe we should pour resources into the Navy because we are an archipelagic 
nation. <BR><BR><B>FOREIGN RELATIONS</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
We should nurture our membership in ASEAN and other Asian forums; APEC and our 
relations with countries like the United States of America, Canada, Australia 
and Latin America. Our ties with Europe and the Middle East are of vital 
importance as well particularly in terms of trade and investment. We must strive 
to contribute our share to the work of the United Nations, of which the 
Philippines is a founding member. <BR><BR><B>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM</B> 
<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>
I believe we should face, once and for all, the challenge of amending our 
Constitution. Among the reforms that I consider urgent are the following: 
<UL>
<LI>The desynchronization of elections; 
<LI>The election of senators by regions; 
<LI>The review of the terms of office of all elective officials of the 
government; 
<LI>The return of supervision and control of the police to the local 
governments; 
<LI>The restoration of the full powers of the Commission on Appointments to 
review presidential appointments; 
<LI>The transfer of court supervision from the Supreme Court to the Department 
of Justice as provided for in the 1935 Constitution; 
<LI>The creation of a two-party system; and 
<LI>The re-examination of the constitutional provisions governing the economy 
and private ownership. </LI></UL>', 'JPE', '', '9606265', '2', '7212000', 'N', '584571', '541913', '1225322', '1745658', '335930', '481004', '362370', '420994', '312857', '407278', '805869', '363607', '176882', '78563', '1527879', '235247', '321', '');

<P><I>Kung walang pangitain - walang kakayahan - at walang moralidad ang mga 
nasa poder, sila\'y nagsisilbing hagupit sa taong-bayan. 
<P>Nilabanan ko ang nais ni Maros na pawalang sala ang mga sundalong pumaslang 
kay Ninoy. Ito ang nagbunsod ng EDSA I. 
<P>Ako\'y hinirang ni Presidente Cory upang kumandidato para sa Senado noong 
1987. 
<P></I>During my first term, I realized that being a Senator required advanced 
and continuing education. So, without neglecting my duties as Senator, I went to 
night school. I took my master\'s degree in public finance graduating summa cum 
laude. I enrolled for a doctorate in fiscal studies, graduating magna cum laude. 

<P>During my two terms as Senator - from 1987 until 1999 - I authored 34 
landmark laws. I wrote the TESDA Law to prepare young people for jobs. I wrote 
the Migrant Workers Act to protect OFWs. I wrote the Death Penalty Law to stop 
heinous crimes. 
<P>I passed the Paternity Leave Act to strengthen the family. A strong family, 
as a I found early in life, is an indispensable support to a strong nation. And 
i founded the Citizens\' DrugWatch to fight drug addiction. My other laws are on 
monetary and fiscal policies and on public health. 
<P>Laws I now would like to write - if i am reelected to the Senate - are those 
that will create jobs and ensure that our society is free of corruption. 
<P><I>Napakarami sa ating mga Pilipino ang nilulumpo ng karalitaan at 
kamangmangan. Mistulang mga pipi ang ating mga manggagawa - sapagkat di nila 
maipaabot sa mga nasa kapangyarihan ang kanilang mga inaasam-asam. At napakarami 
sa ating mga pinuno - bulag na sa salapi - ay bingi pa rin sa himutok ng 
kanilang mga nasasakop. 
<P></I>These past three years, ang buong bansa natin ay nasalanta ng katiwalian. 
Like the polio virus, corruption entered the nation\'s bloodstream - and if left 
unchecked, maaring masalanta ang buong bansa. 
<P>This was why I joined Heherson Alvarez and Mike Defensor in making the 
accusations na naging basihan ng mga Articles of Impeachment against President 
Estrada. 
<P>EDSA II launched this People Power Coalition with a clear purpose. 
<P>Never again should we put in power the minions of a corrupt administration. 
<P>Never again should we stand by and watch powerful people prevent Filipinos 
from walking tall and proud in the global community. 
<P>This - my beloved countrymen - is the parable of my life that I offer to you. 
Together, let us do great things for our country and our people.</P></FONT>', 'Samboan, Cebu', '', '', '', '2', '20010623104303', '', '', 'Boy', '', '6743297', '1', '5186007', 'N', '387174', '144829', '786496', '782383', '295629', '603158', '941044', '325101', '281213', '273348', '360742', '126778', '107682', '130510', '997809', '199259', '142', '');

dramatically. Also, he has retrieved some 448 carnapped or missing vehicles

four generals and two colonels, who headed major Manila police commands; banned 
officers from playing golf during office hours at the PNP\'s sprawling Camp Crame 
headquarters in suburban Quezon City; and stopped the police checkpoints on 
delivery vans bringing vegetables, fish and other supplies to Manila from the

<P class=newstitle>Carrying on the Legacy</P>
<P class=newstext>Senator Ramon Magsaysay, Jr. is the only son of the late and 
beloved Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay and Mrs. Luz Banzon-Magsaysay. He 
was born in Manila in 1938. He is married to Marilou Kahn-Magsaysay. His two 
children, Francisco and Margarita, are now both married and with families of 
their own. 
<P class=newstext>His father\'s rise to the presidency in 1953 taught Jun 
Magsaysay and his sisters, Milagros and Teresita, the virtues of integrity, 
honesty and having a strong passion for the welfare of the common man. Inside 
majestic Malacañang the Magsaysays lived humbly, untouched by selfish ambitions 
and unmarred by lust for power. 
<P class=newstitle>An Early Responsibility 
<P class=newstext>With President Magsaysay\'s sudden death in 1957,18-year-old 
Jun inherited greater responsibilities that enabled him to recognize the value 
of perseverance and hard work. He was no longer his father\'s boy. Instantly, he 
had to become the man of the house. 
<P class=newstitle>Education 
<P class=newstext>Jun spent most of his academic years at the De La Salle 
College in Manila where he earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering. He pursued 
his academic studies at Harvard School of Business Administration in Boston, 
Massachusetts and in New York University Graduate School of Business 
Administration. He returned to the Philippines armed with new skills, knowledge, 
and vision that would later become a strong force behind the development of a 
major industry in the country. </P>
<P class=newstitle>Youngest Congressman</P>
<P class=newstext>Being the only son of a revered president, Jun Magsaysay 
carries with him the responsibility of continuing the legacy of championing the 
cause of the common man. Thus in 1966 he was elected as a Congressional 
Representative for the lone district of Zambales. Dubbed as the Benjamin of the 
House of Representatives, he was the youngest Congressman to be elected to the 
Lower House at the age of 27. In Congress, he authored and sponsored bills 
designed to promote the development of science and technology and improve the 
welfare and benefits of private and government workers. Taking after his father, 
Jun bravely declared his positions on issues that affect the conditions of the 
common man.</P>
<P class=newstitle>A Man Who Can Say \'No\'</P>
<P class=newstext>In 1969, he ran for re-election under the opposition Liberal 
Party. Then First Lady Imelda Marcos offered to endorse his candidacy if he will 
leave LP and run under the administration\'s Nacionalista Party. Declining the 
offer, Jun Magsaysay stayed with LP and<BR>was defeated by the powerful NP 
machinery which instead drafted his cousin, Antonio Diaz.</P>
<P class=newstitle>Self-Made Businessman</P>
<P class=newstext>After a productive four-year term in Congress he returned to 
work in the private sector where he ventured into various industries including 
garment manufacturing and export, semi-conductor, and travel and tourism. Armed 
with his business education and engineering skills, Jun pioneered the cable 
television business in the country. Today, with over 550 cable operators 
nationwide, the cable TV industry business has turned into a P2-billion a year 
industry.</P>
<P class=newstitle>Returning to Public Service</P>
<P class=newstext>In 1995, President Ramos invited Jun to join the senatorial 
slate of the Lakas-Laban Coalition as a guest LP candidate. He landed third 
place among the twelve elected senators and first among the neophyte candidates. 
Once again the Filipino people elected a Magsaysay to be one of their leaders in 
government. They trusted the integrity of the son of their beloved President to 
continue the legacy of serving the cause of the common man.</P>
<P class=newstitle>J.O.B.S.</P>
<P class=newstext>In the Senate, Jun Magsaysay worked within the objective of 
providing opportunities that would help improve the living conditions of the 
ordinary Filipino. His program of government is summarized as \'<B>J.O.B.S.</B>\', 
the acronym for Jobs, Opportunities, Business and Security. The laws he helped 
enact were geared toward expanding business and employment opportunities, 
promoting national unity and security.</P>
<P class=newstitle>Quest for Moral Governance</P>
<P class=newstext>On October 12, 2000, five months before he is to embark on a 
re-election bid, Magsaysay resigned from the administration coalition to support 
the people\'s call for the President\'s resignation. His decision to sever ties 
with the administration came in light of clamor for moral governance, with Jun 
Magsaysay believing that the President has &amp;quot;lost his moral authority to 
govern the nation&amp;quot;. Once again, Magsaysay had shown that he is ready to 
turn his back on a powerful machinery that would have ensured his political 
survival, in exchange for a reformed and morally upright government.</P>
<P class=newstitle>Mission to Carry on the Legacy</P>
<P class=newstext>Indeed, President Ramon Magsaysay\'s commitment to the 
Filipinos did not die with him in that tragic plane crash. His son, Jun 
Magsaysay, is living proof that the Filipino people have not entirely lost a 
great leader, he left behind a son to carry on the legacy.</P>', 'Manila', '', '', '', '2', '20010623104303', '', '', 'Jun', '', '11187447', '1', '8505158', 'Y', '766343', '319890', '1422639', '1499971', '599598', '1150881', '1158939', '457435', '313252', '346928', '633670', '197975', '232623', '146493', '1623595', '317044', '171', '');

<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>In running for senator under 
the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Laban) ticket, Dong Puno has an eight-point 
program designed to help Government uplift the living standards of our people. 
What he is pledged to do, particularly for those at the grassroots level, can be 
summed up in two words--- <B>DONG PUNO</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>This acronym stands for the 
following:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><B><FONT size=4>D</FONT></B> 
- dunong </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Strengthening basic 
education is the ultimate social equalizer: it will give the rich and the poor 
equal opportunities to quality learning. Hence, Dong Puno is in favor of a 
closer cooperation between the Executive Branch and Congress in shifting the 
bulk of the education budget from tertiary to basic education. To correct the 
current education job mismatch, he is for selecting - and further developing - 
Centers of Excellence from among the existing educational institutions in each 
region and province. Schools should also closely coordinate with the various 
industries to determine the real demand of employers in each sector. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=4><B>O</B></FONT><FONT 
face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2> - oportunidad</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Any program to expand 
opportunities of jobs or livelihood endeavors should consider the masses in the 
countryside. Therefore, Dong Puno will support moves to fully implement the 
Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act, which is anchored on a 
labor-intensive rural infrastructure buildup. He will also back measures to 
improve the Philippine capability to supply qualified workers in the area of 
information technology or IT. There is also the problem of providing retraining 
for overseas workers, many of whom want to return home but are prevented from 
doing so by the lack of opportunities back home. To improve opportunities for 
acquiring low-cost homes, he also supports a government policy designed to 
sustain a demand-driven approach to housing. The supply driven policy in the 
pre-Estrada era resulted in costly mistakes that we should not repeat. He is for 
development of resettlement for squatters that include not only adequate basic 
services but also livelihood opportunities. N - No to drugs The drug problem is 
now very serious. Dong Puno supports taking a firm stand against drug 
trafficking and dealing a hard blow against those involved in the supply side of 
this scourge. There is also a need to focus on prevention and improving the 
rehabilitation system for victims of drug abuse. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=4><B>G</B></FONT><FONT 
face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2> - good government &amp; 
justice</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Dong Puno believes that 
corruption and congestion of court cases are the two main problems of judicial 
administration. Competent lawyers should be attracted to the bench by offering 
them competitive salary scale and fringe benefits. The court should be made the 
bulwarks of equity and justice. The perception of some that the courts are a 
market place where life and liberties are traded to the highest bidder must be 
reversed. He also wants to pursue the rehabilitation of the penal system so that 
offenders would come out of prison moulded into useful citizens 
again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><FONT size=4><B>P</B></FONT> 
- puno at pagkain </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>For Dong Puno, issues 
concerning the environment should take into account the welfare of the sectors 
who depend on the environment for survival. These include the poor who rely on 
our farmlands and our forests for their means of livelihood. Thus, Dong Puno 
will support programs and policies that promote sustainable development and at 
the same time provide jobs and alternative livelihood opportunities for sectors 
that may be displaced or adversely affected as a result of these initiatives. 
Sustainable development should meet the requirements of the present generation 
of Filipinos without endangering the capacity of future generations to meet 
their own needs. Dong Puno also believes that now is the time for Government to 
come up with a realistic program to finally deal with our forest denudation. He 
will spearhead a drive in the Senate so that Congress can pass legislation that 
will resolve the problem of deforestation and allow reasonable commercial 
activities to ensure the welfare of dependents in wood-based industries, upland 
dwellers and other affected sectors. He believes that due regard should also be 
given to the legitimate concerns of responsible loggers who have a clear and 
sustained reforestation program in place. He will likewise push for the full 
implementation of the Clean Air Act, but with the welfare of the Filipino masa 
in mind. Also, Dong Puno will support a massive infrastructure buildup in the 
country that will help sustain and even improve upon the gains of our food 
security programs. His focus will be on building more farm-to-market roads, 
irrigation projects and post-harvest facilities.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><B><FONT size=4>U</FONT></B> 
- unity and peace </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Dong Puno considers peace 
and order as a vital factor in maintaining investor confidence and sustaining 
economic growth. Thus, he will support programs addressing poverty, particularly 
in areas where communist and Muslim insurgencies are rampant. For him, the 
government should mount more aggressive efforts to continue the peace 
process.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><B><FONT size=4>N</FONT></B> 
- nasyonalismo</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Dong Puno believes in the 
ability and capability of the Filipino people to handle whatever difficulties 
confront them. He is pushing Laban\'s politics of hope or optimism. As you can 
see, his campaign is anchored on \"Puno ng Pag-asa para sa Masa.\" This brand of 
Filipino nationalism can be expected to be further developed, with the 
successful implementation of the above-mentioned initiatives. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=4>O </FONT><FONT 
face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>- open communication</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>The former press secretary 
and presidential spokesman believes that a free press is a vital instrument in 
the development of an informed and responsible citizenry. Legitimate journalists 
are true fiscalizers who help prevent or expose government abuses. Dong Puno is 
for an unfettered media that protect our citizens, while remaining committed to 
high professional ethical standards and the basic tenets of professional 
journalism. He is also committed to support measures that will ensure the 
regular employment of journalists, especially the provincial correspondents, as 
well as provide them with more benefits, such as insurance and hazard pay.

AGENDA Senatorial Candidate Wigberto \"Bobby\" Tañada </B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>For almost a week in January 
2001, millions of our compatriots gathered at EDSA and in other urban centers to 
demand that governance, in essence and in conduct, be anchored on the principles 
of justice, transparency, an equal playing field, and a broad-based economic 
growth. They emerged victorious in the first step they took, and such victory 
has made us realize anew that governance is not just by government but by the 
people themselves. Following up on this lesson, we are currently challenged to 
transform government into a completely enabling institution for the people\'s 
will to prevail and their interests to be served.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>I am now running for the 
Senate because the Senate plays a crucial role in providing an enabling body of 
laws for the complete realization of the demands made manifest by the People 
Power II. My agenda in the Senate, if once again voted, will focus on 
institutionalizing measures to improve the accountability system in government, 
curb corruption and the growth of monopolies, reform the budget process to make 
it more efficient and effective, and intensify social reforms to propel a 
broad-based economic growth.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><B>Improving the 
Accountability System in Government </B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>To instill a sense of 
greater accountability among public officials, especially those occupying high

inspectorate general similar to that of the United States</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Amend the bank secrecy law

the Growth of Monopolies</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Privatization, particularly

corruption and the growth of monopolies. To correct this, I will work to amend 
the Build, Transfer and Operate (BOT) law to the effect that:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>The rules in the bidding 
process in any privatization project will be widely publicized, made more

</LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><B>Reforming the Budget 
Process</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>The yearly exercise of both

framework</I></B><I> </I>that is based not only on the government\'s medium-term

<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Economic growth alone will 
not work to reduce poverty and improve the livelihood capacities and quality of 
life of the impoverished majority of Filipinos. At the very least, it should be

liberalization. To complement and temper economic growth with such reform 
measures that will improve the poor\'s access to and participation in the 
processes and benefits of development,</FONT><FONT

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>The Senate and the House of 
Representative must continue to be the conscience of the nation and the positive

should not hesitate to back up reform measures initiated by the executive branch 
in support of a responsive and responsible governance. However, they should not 
also hesitate to counter such moves that will work against the interests of the 
Filipino people.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><B>My Priority Bills</B> 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>1. A national land use 
policy - The enactment of this bill into law is long overdue. The reason for 
pushing this is quite straightforward: Land is not an unlimited resource. The 
spate of land conversion and even the conversion of forested areas into 
alienable and disposable lands have been done at the whim of local government 
units and even Congress. Land use must be rationalized and its framework must be 
provided by Congress. Food security and environmental security are 
non-negotiable bases for a framework on land use.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>2. Declaring the coconut 
levy as public fund - This fund which is estimated to have reached P100 billion 
is an exaction from our coconut farmers. More than a decade has passed and they 
have yet to reap the fruits of this exaction, the basis of which is a law that 
purportedly intends to push the coconut industry\'s development. While the matter 
is now with the courts, I am of the position that Congress, as a policy-making 
body, can and should, once and for all, declare the fund as public to finally 
give our the small coconut farmers what is due them in terms of concrete 
projects and programs that will modernize and develop the sector and push 
R&amp;D to the limits as the industry, I maintain, has a lot of 
potential</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>3. Absentee Voting for 
Overseas Filipinos - When I was still Senator of the 9th Congress, I already 
filed a bill to put this into law but up to now, we\'re already on the 11th 
Congress, it still remains a bill. Overseas voting by qualified Filipinos is 
actually mandated by the Constitution, to wit: \"Congress shall provide a system 
for securing the secrecy and sanctity of the ballot as well as a system for 
absentee voting by qualified Filipinos abroad.\" (Sec. 2, Article V) I believe 
that our OFWs are among the most educated among our citizens. If we are to break 
away from the traditional patronage politics, OFWs whose main concerned would be 
to come home and be united with their families, will most likely contribute to a 
more enlightened electoral exercise </FONT></P>', '[Source: <A HREF=\"http://www2.tanada.net/bobby/profile2.html#educ\">http://www2.tanada.net/bobby/profile2.html#educ</A>]<BR><BR>

<P>He was born to a simple family on December 13, 1949 in Moriones, Tondo, 
Manila, the second child in a brood of nine of a government employee and a 
seafood dealer. At a very young age, he was already helping his mother sell 
shrimp and fish in the Divisoria market. 
<P>\"I learned from my mother what it takes to be an entrepreneur,\" he revealed. 
\"And it means to work really hard to achieve your dreams.\" In Divisoria, he 
marvelled at the volumes of sales the Chinese merchants were making and vowed 
early on to become an entrepreneur. 
<P>Manny Villar was a working student at the University of the Philippines, the 
premier institution of higher learning in the country, where he obtained his 
undergraduate and masters degree in business administration and accountancy. By 
then, he was already putting in long hours as a fish and shrimp trader where the 
action starts at the ungodly hours of the early morning when the catch lands on 
the market. 
<P><STRONG><FONT face=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Early 
entrepreneurship</FONT> </STRONG>
<P>After graduation, he tried his hand as an accountant at the country\'s biggest 
accounting firm, Sycip Gorres and Velayo (SGV), but resigned shortly to embark 
on his own seafood delivery business. It was then that his innovative business 
mind was already apparent. 
<P>When a restaurant he was delivering stocks to did not pay him, he printed out 
\"meal tickets\" which he persuaded the restaurant owners to honor. He then sold 
these tickets at a discount to office workers. It took him one whole year to 
liquidate his receivables. 
<P>With his business down, he worked briefly as a financial analyst at the 
Private Development Corporation of the Philippines. His job was to sell World 
Bank loans but despite the attractive rates there were no takers. Convinced that 
he could make a go on his own again, he quit his job and promptly applied for 
one of the loans. 
<P>So with P10,000 initial capital in 1975, Villar bought two reconditioned 
trucks and started his sand-and-gravel business in Las Piñas. Las Piñas then was 
in the throes of a construction boom as one of the premier residential suburbs 
south of Manila. 
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><FONT face=verdana size=-1>Housing 
innovator</FONT></FONT></STRONG> 
<P>It is here while delivering construction materials to big developers that 
Manny Villar came upon the idea of selling house-and-lot packages when the 
convention then was for homebuyers to buy lots and build on them. 
<P>When developers were offering 240 sqm. lots, he started to build houses at 
120 sqm. at very affordable prices. He priced his offerings within the range of 
government-provided loans so that homebuyers need not fork out a large equity. 
And even with the equity requirement, he came out with in-house financing backed 
with a \"second mortgage\" on the house (the first mortgage being with the 
principal loan giver) so that homebuyers can immediately move in. 
<P>His projects sold like hotcakes he became a millionaire at only 26 years old. 

<P>He then initiated mass housing projects to achieve economies of scale and 
introduced development projects within existing subdivisions by buying off their 
rights of way. His various innovations practically created the country\'s mass 
housing industry the Philippine Center of Investigative Journalism calls him 
\'the dean of the [Philippine] real estate industry.\"

</FONT></STRONG>
<P>By the mid-1980s, in the aftermath of the economic crisis spawned by the 
Aquino Assasination, Villar consolidated his business and collected on his 
receivables. Other big developers, on the other hand, continued on their 
business expansion. When the crunch came with the deep devaluation of the peso, 
many big developers collapsed while Villar was busy buying rawlands at give-away 
prices. 
<P>Villar recalled that many developers then just packed their bags and left the 
country in the aftershocks of the crisis. But he stayed on and believed in the 
country\'s eventual recovery. \"I was seeing the big taipans like Henry Sy 
building this biggest mall in the country and Lucio Tan and John Gokongwei all 
expanding. I said to myself that if I\'m wrong then at least I\'m in their 
company.\" 
<P>With a traditional market shrinking, he began to offer his projects to 
overseas contract workers who were then awash with cash after the peso 
devaluation. Overseas workers first bought small appliances from Henry Sy\'s SM 
Malls to fuel surging consumer demand. After which, they started to buy the big 
ticket item from Manny Villar\'s Camella and Palmera Homes. 
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><FONT face=verdana size=-1>Bi</FONT>ggest 
homebuilder</FONT></STRONG> 
<P>When the economy bounced back with the assumption of the Aquino government, 
Villar was already holding an extensive landbank which became the foundation of 
his housing empire. \"I continued in housing development seeing that I\'m the only 
one left in the business,\" he said. \"Housing, after all, is a fundamental need.\" 

<P>By 1995, when he listed his holding company C&amp;P Homes at the stock 
exchange, he was already holding more than 2,000 hectares of prime lands and had 
already built more than 100,000 homes to become the biggest homebuilder in 
Southeast Asia. 
<P>For his business achievements, he was made cover story in the Far Eastern 
Economic Review and his life story featured in Asiaweek, Forbes, AsiaMoney and 
Asian Business Review. 
<P><STRONG><FONT face=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Public 
service</FONT>&nbsp;</STRONG> 
<P>In 1992, Manny Villar entered another turn in his career when he decided to 
run for congressman in the lone district of Las Piñas and Muntinlupa. \"Going 
into public service,\' he said, \'seems natural because my business, low-cost 
housing, has a social dimension. It is a form of public service to make housing 
affordable to many of our people.\" 
<P>In a stunning political debut, Villar won with the most overwhelming mandate 
among Metro Manila congressmen. He promptly applied his economic and managerial 
expertise as a key member of the House\'s economic team, marshaling in economic 
reforms measures of the Ramos Administration such as the New Foreign Investments 
Act and the restructuring of the Central Bank of the Philippines. He was the 
House representative in the government\'s negotiations with the International 
Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., in 1992. 
<P>He also oversaw various infrastructure projects in his districts like 
concreting of numerous roads and building the Alabang-Zapote Flyover. He 
introduced the \"Friendship Route\" to alleviate the traffic problem in southern 
Manila by persuading subdivision homeowners to open up their roads to the 
general public. 
<P>He succeeded in passing Republic Act 8003, Declaring Certain Areas in Las 
Piñas as Tourist Spots. The law formalized his program of rehabilitating 
historical and cultural landmarks in Las Piñas starting with the world-famous 
Bamboo Organ and Church. The on-going project, dubbed \"Las Piñas Historical 
Corridor\" covers the stretch of the Old District and may even rival the 
Intramuros and Vigan restoration projects. 
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><FONT face=verdana size=-1></FONT><STRONG><FONT 
face=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Committed environmentalist</FONT></STRONG> 
</FONT></STRONG>
<P>A staunch environmentalist, he initiated his own privately-funded tree 
planting drive in his district. He developed a P10 million tree nursery besides 
his home and has quietly undertaken a dedicated tree-planting drive, complete 
with maintenance and watering of tree seedlings planted in the open spaces of 
the community. 
<P>During his first term, he steered Muntinlupa to cityhood to be followed by 
Las Piñas the following term. He pointed out: \"As a developer, I have always 
envisioned these two communities as the \'Twin Cities of the South\' of Manila. In 
fact, Las Piñas and Muntinlupa are the two fastest growing communities in the 
country today.\" 
<P>In 1995, Manny Villar ran for re-election and won an unprecedented 142,000 
votes, the highest number of votes for a congressman in the entire country. 
Winning media acclaim as outstanding congressman and the respect and recognition 
of his peers, he was elected to chair the Committee on Entrepreneurship. 
<P>As one of the leading entrepreneurs in the country, he championed the cause 
of small and medium enterprises. He authored and passed into law the landmark 
New Magna Carta for Small and Medium Enterprises (RA 8289). He initiated 
creative legislation such as establishment of the Small and Medium Enterprises 
Stock Exchange and Business One-Stop-Shop centers. 
<P>By the end of his second term of office, Villar had already proven beyond 
doubt his capacity for excellence as a true Filipino entrepreneur and a 
brilliant public servant who can get things done.

face=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Speaker of the House 
</FONT></STRONG></FONT></STRONG>
<P>It was no surprise then to those in the know during his third term of office 
when he gained the remarkable acclaim of 171 of 220 congressmen as the Speaker 
of the 11th Congress of the House of Representatives. 
<P>In a time when the country is slowly recovering from a host of economic and 
political crises, the election of the \'brown taipan\' at the helm of Congress 
signaled a watershed event in Philippine political history. The rise of Manny 
Villar ushered in a new consensus of leadership based on managerial skills and 
not simply on oratory and rhetoric. 
<P>By his first year of office, Villar undertook three pathbreaking reforms. In 
support of President Joseph Ejercito Estrada\'s call, he succeeded first in 
marshaling consensus in the House to reform the \'pork barrel\' system by limiting 
congressional discretion projects to the set parameters of the Executive\'s 
development policies. Second, he launched a revamp of leadership by appointing 
at least seven neophyte congressmen to head powerful committees like ecology and 
banks. Finally, he set a strong and principled stance on environmental 
protection legislation with the passage of the Clean Air Act, a measure three 
previous congresses for more than ten years were not able to pass. 
<P>On his second year in office, Manny Villar steered the 11th Congress into a 
record-breaking achievement in legislation and economic reforms. Among the 
pathbreaking measures he shepherded into law were the Retail Trade 
Liberalization Act, the New Central Bank Act, the New Securities Code, and the 
New Banking Act. But it was on the third month during his third year in office 
that Villar made his indelible mark on the country\'s history. 
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><STRONG><FONT face=verdana color=#003366 
size=-1>Defining moment</FONT></STRONG> </FONT></STRONG>
<P>Beyond being a super achiever in business and politics, Manny Villar seized 
the entire nation\'s attention and inspiration when single-handedly, bearing the 
full responsibility of his decision, he showed the Filipino people what true 
political leadership and craftmanship means, by sending President Estrada\'s 
impeachment articles straight to the Senate, brooking no interruption or delay 
from anyone. 
<P>Manny Villar\'s moment of truth when he opened Congress\' session last Nov. 13, 
at the cost of his Speakership, was to reveal to the Filipino people, not only a 
man of steadfast principles and unparalleled personal track record, but a true 
political leader who can be a source of courage, example and inspiration. 
<P>Speaker Manny Villar, despite his accomplishments and heroism, has remained 
simple and unaffected. A true family man, he is a devoted husband to Mrs. 
Cynthia Aguilar-Villar, scion of a political family in Las Piñas, and a warm and 
loving father to sons Paolo and Mark and daughter Camille.<FONT

INSERT INTO party VALUES ( '605', 'Partido Ng Manggagawa', 'PM', '2001', 'Y', '0', '2', '0', '0', '', '<P>
The Partido ng Manggagawa or PM aims to be the political and electoral party of the working class in the Philippines. If in other countries, especially in Europe, labor parties represent the workers, then PM is its equivalent in the country.
<P>
The Partido ng Manggagawa was established at the Bahay ng Alumni last February 12 on very the day that labor leader Ka Popoy Lagman was laid to rest. At the time of his death, Ka Popoy was devoting his time into setting up and laying the groundwork for the Partido ng Manggagawa.
<P>
Currently registered as a party-list group, PM will actively participate in the coming elections. PM will campaign to put three representatives in Congress. The party-list nominees of PM are three union presidents--Rene Magtubo of Fortune Tobacco, Victor Briz of Gelmart Industries and Gerry Rivera of PALEA. Aside from the three representatives targeted to sit in Congress through the party-list, PM will be fielding candidates in the local elections.
<P>
The Partido ng Mangagawa is the magic formula to unite the fragmented labor movement and organize the millions of unorganized workers. It is also the missing link to advance the struggle of the working for protection against the scourge of globalization.
<P>
Founded on the belief that existing formations such as local unions and labor federations are limited in their capacity to effectively protect the workers’ interests in this age of globalization, PM will bring the struggle within the parliament. The goal of its participation in the elections is to enact pro-labor legislation and ensure the implementation of pro-worker policies. Its minimum platform is the protection of workers’ interests; its maximum platform is the emancipation of the working class.
<P>
Here lies the stark difference of Partido ng Manggagawa from other political parties. While the traditional political parties pretentiously claim to stand for the interests of the poor, PM will clearly carry the workers’ class standpoint. All of these traditional political parties are proven and undeniably pro-capitalist. The platform, leadership and membership of PM, in its heart and soul, are purely for the interests of every workingman.
<P>
PM is organized at the grassroots level, with individual memberships. Therefore, PM will go beyond existing labor formations and federations since PM membership is not union-based. Each member will undergo seminars and orientation regarding PM before being considered full-pledged PM members. This kind of organizational formation is geared towards developing the labor vote in the Philippines.
<P>
Partido ng Manggagawa believes and will work for the creation of a solid labor vote. For years, labor has given their vote to traditional politicians for the mere fact that there is no political party concretely carrying their interests. With the establishment of the Partido ng Manggagawa, workers nationwide will have a party with which they can confidently give their vote and believe that this party will truly fight for their cause.
<P>
The concept of a labor vote is the like the block voting delivered by Iglesia ni Cristo or El Shaddai. Manalo or Velarde do not have to go to Malacanang to get a hearing, instead politicians and officials themselves pay their respects to the two religious leaders. The labor vote during elections and labor power in the streets will compel the government and politicians not to ignore the voice and demands of the working class.
<P>
The creation of a distinct and solid labor vote will be PM’s main weapon in carrying out its platform. The labor vote, with a single command, will be used for the government to give due respect to the working class. The labor vote will give a lesson to anyone who will go against the interests of the working class. This unity of the working class, and not the PM itself, will ultimately be the direct and actual instrument that will bring about the social change and social justice for the working class.', '<P>

On November 17, 2000, CIBAC also assisted the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) in filing cases of plunder, graft and corruption, bribery, violation of Code of Conduct for Government employees, and perjury against known public officials. 
<P>
CIBAC has not limited its presence to the courts. It was also involved in several peaceful rallies since 1998 to reiterate its stand against corruption and its other forms. This culminated in its presence at the EDSA shrine during what is now called EDSA II.', '', 'headmaster@cibac.org', '6377203', '4th flloor, Unit 409, Amberland Building,

<P>
We believe that people power phenomenon in Edsa2 is a rejection of old politics which is based on wealth and violence.  That historical event resembles our new politics which is based on knowledge and information.  
<P>
We believe that the spontaneity of the Edsa  people power can be elevated into a higher form – more organized and institutionalized nationwide- that shall allow for broader ownership, wider participation, sharpening of its perspectives  in reaping and protecting its gains and even creating new victories.
<P>
We believe that the youth and students armed with means to rapid information exchanges between them, represented the most formidable force in Edsa2.   
<P>
We believe the same truth will hold to a knowledge-based New Politics we profess as it evolves into its higher form. 
<P>
We believe that the hope of sustaining the gains of Edsa2 lies mainly on the youth and students who are advocates of the principles of New Politics.  
<P>
We believe that Edsa 2 is a manifestation of the first Edsa’s  strength and shortcoming.  Strength in the sense that power mainly based on knowledge and information was revalidated as potent enough to oust even a popularly elected, well entrenched but corrupt government.  A shortcoming in the sense that Edsa 1  failed to address the ensuing complacency and apathy  of people especially the youth who seemingly fell into slumber after a euphoric victory – thus allowing the rise to power of an incompetent government. 
<P>
We believe, that more than ever, the current reality is akin to a knowledge-based and Information Technology enabled politics, with the youth as its pillar and bridgehead.
<P>
We believe that in the immediate future, knowledge and information shall represent the most important resource of the new system of wealth creation in the unfolding new economy.
<P>
We believe that in the new economy, People’s access to information technology is as important as providing them access to other factors of production like, land, raw material and capital.
<P>
We believe again that the youth shall play a very important role for our country ‘s effective participation in the highly competitive and connected world with a so called digital economy. 
<P>
We believe that the youth possesses the greatest  potential to effectively steer societies and small economies in transition,  (like cooperatives and other grassroots-based enterprises) to the new economic order.
<P> 
We believe that the youth in a conducive environment, shall serve as a well-spring of novel business ideas and shall  play the role of an accelerator in the new economy where speed and innovation is of prime importance. 
<P>
We believe that the youth especially the students, being a pulsating sector, is in the best position to bring the benefit of the new economy in general and information technology in particular, to the grassroots level, thus, narrowing  the Digital Divide.
<P>
We believe that with a favorable environment,  the youth can immediately emulate the “learn and earn” opportunities in the knowledge-based new economy turning campuses into one of its  building block.
<P>
We believe that, today and more true than ever in this country’s history, the youth indeed, is the hope of the fatherland.', '[Source:  brochureIT.doc brochure sent to info@vote.ph by Alexander E. Casiple]<BR><BR>

ALTERNATIVE ACTION is a newly formed partylist organization.  It is supported by former leading youth activists who worked with the poverty stricken people, listened to their cries and felt their pains. Like the proverbial wave, activists are deeply immersed (within the grassroots) when the sea is calm but rise to heights when there is storm.  With today’s realities, the activists are ready to rise once again to new heights as the strong wind of change is blustering the country. 
<P>
The birthing of ALTERNATIVE ACTION came amidst a social condition where CHANGE in the economic and political arena was so rapid that while it offers rich opportunities it is also loaded with dangers to humanity, our country, our organizations and ourselves. 
<P>
With the swiftness of change, the compression of the three
dimensions of time: past, present, and the future is transpiring in ALTERNATIVE ACTION.  Drawing inspiration from the past, ALTERNATIVE ACTION relives the wisdom, dedication, creativity, fervor, passion and selflessness of former youth activists.  With in ALTERNATIVE ACTION, such attributes are being relevantly imbued to the effort of all parties especially the youth and students  in facing the  challenges of the present reality .  This in turn leads ALTERNATIVE ACTION  to identify new development imperatives in preparing the whole country for the fast approaching future.  
<P>
ALTERNATIVE ACTION recognizes the important role of the Youth in bridging the lessons of the past to the conduct of the present and to the vision of the future.', '[Source:  nrebrochIT.doc brochure sent to info@vote.ph by Alexander E. Casiple]<BR><BR>

<B>WHY VACC WANTS REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS</B>
<P>
We\'re giving the electoral struggle a chance where we can assert our rights as crime victims and survivors.
<P>
We realize we cannot expect much from the present political set-up to deal firmly with crime and crime victims. The government has not eliminated the conditions that foster crime.  And when a crime is committed, the chief concern of criminal justice agencies has been apprehending and dealing with the criminal, and that the  victim  or witness is frequently forgotten or further victimized by the criminal justice system. 
<P>
We believe that the present justice system in the country provides more rights and attention to perpetrators of crime than to victims.  Crime victims have few participatory rights, too few agencies/organizations providing scarce services and assistance and no laws passed that articulate and protect victims’ rights like in other countries. The number of crime victims is increasing by leaps and bounds.  Certainly, VACC and crime victims’ groups would not want any increase in their membership anymore.  
<P>
How the justice system will handle itself in pursuing justice for the Filipino people as victims of Erap\'s criminal and corrupt governance is a test case. Just the same, there is a need to institutionalize a law basically working for the interests of victims of crime, particularly of common crimes.
<P>
We want Congress to pass a Crime Victims Rights Law that will give victims the same dignity, respect, and rights afforded the other players in the criminal justice system. A Law that recognizes victims\' rights that includes five basic rights: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>the right to be treated with dignity and respect, 
<LI>the right to be informed; 
<LI>the right to be present; 
<LI>the right to be compensated and 
<LI>the right to be heard throughout the criminal justice process. 
</OL>
<P>
<B>VACC LEGISLATIVE  AGENDA</B>
<P>
VACC believes that crime is a social menace.  But corruption is a social base of criminality.  Crime and corruption are symptoms of social inequalities in Philippine society.  These social inequalities produce the poverty of the many.  And the poverty of the many stems from the greed of the few.    That is why our battle cry is :  fight crime and corruption!   Because they are symptoms of a larger problem,  VACC believes that to attack at the roots of the problem, we must address the social roots.  THAT can be done with crime victims being in solidarity with the basic sectors of society fighting for social justice.
<P>
Since year 2000, over 100,000 Filipinos  were victims of heinous  crimes. These do not include other victims like the victims of war in Mindanao and political violence.  These aren\'t just statistics, they\'re people.   Their lives and the lives of their families have been changed forever. 
<P>
Therefore,  VACC must work for securing basic changes that must be institutionalized in the Philippine justice system.   It must work along with other sectors in promoting wholistic advocacies while focusing on the following to fight crime and corruption:

We may never have a crime and victim-free society in the immediate future but  we will never know if we don\'t try.  All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.  VACC will support in Congress all legislative acts that will address the root problems of crime – poverty of the many because of the greed of the few,
<P>
As to having different anticrime and crimevictims groups, it is the same with labor, women, peasants, national minorities and others which have different groups or organizations too.  
<P>
VACC is different from other anticrime groups because it has elevated its struggle to the level of political, economic and social concerns NOT only crime and victims\' concerns.  
<P>
VACC believes that we should not only fight crime and if we are crime victims, our concern is not only to follow up our cases until their just conclusion.  Our long term  concern must be that because we have been victimized, we must bring victimization forward as a social issue and make this a political concern in government that must be addressed at ITS ROOTS.', '', '', 'vacc@pacific.net.ph', '', '', '', '20010511114152', '', '', '2001');

The President of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, holds many records. Elected as Senator during her first try in politics in 1992, she was re-elected Senator in 1995 with nearly 16 million votes, the highest number of votes in Philippine history. She was elected Vice President of the Philippines in 1998 with almost 13 million votes, the largest mandate in the history of presidential or vice presidential elections. She was sworn in as the 14th President of the Philippines on 20 January 2001 by Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. after the Supreme Court unanimously declared the position of President vacant, the second woman to be swept into the Presidency by a peaceful People Power revolution (EDSA II).

<P>
The President is the daughter of the late President and Mrs. Diosdado Macapagal, who were well known for their integrity and simple but dignified lifestyle. During the Presidency of Diosdado Macapagal, the Philippines was second only to Japan in economic progress in Asia.

<P>
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was valedictorian of her high school class at Assumption Convent, was consistently on the Dean\\\'s List in Georgetown University in Washington DC, and graduated magna cum laude at Assumption College. She obtained a Master\\\'s degree in Economics from the Ateneo de Manila University and a doctorate degree in Economics from the University of the Philippines.

<P>
Macapagal-Arroyo joined the Philippine government in 1986 during the administration of President Corazon Aquino, who appointed her Undersecretary of Trade and Industry. During her tenure in the Senate, she authored 55 laws on economic and social reform and was named outstanding Senator several times. When she was elected Vice President, President Joseph Estrada appointed her as concurrent Secretary of Social Welfare and Development, a post she held until her resignation from the Cabinet on 12 October 2000.', 'N', 'N', '', '', '', '', '2', '20010619101857', '', '', 'GMA', '0', '1', '');
