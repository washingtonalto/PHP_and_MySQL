Noong 1998, 14 lang sa dapat ay 52 nakalaang pwesto ang nakuha ng 13  party-list organizations.  Isa sa mga nanalo ang Sanlakas.\r\n<P>\r\nAng isang party-list organization ay makakakuha ng isang pwesto kung makakalikom ito ng minimum na 2% ng kabuuang boto sa party-list. Bawat partido ay pinapayagang makakuha ng maksimum na tatlong (3) pwesto.\r\nHalimbawa: Kung ang kabuuang boto sa party-list ay umabot ng 20 milyon, ang isang partido ay dapat makakuha ng 400,000 boto para makakuha ng isang pwesto, 800,000 sa dalawang pwesto at 1.2 milyon sa tatlong pwesto. \r\n<P>\r\nSa party-list system, ang ibinoboto  ay partido, hindi tao.\r\n<P>\r\nHalimbawa, sa balota:\r\n<P>\r\nSenator: Maria <BR>\r\nDistrict Representative: Juan <BR>\r\nParty-List Representative: SANLAKAS <BR>\r\n<P>\r\nKaya\'t tandaan, ngayong eleksyon, dalawa ang ating iboboto sa Kongreso.

He was slain in front of the factory gates in Imus as he was going home from work.\r\n<P>\r\nIbe is a leader of PM in Cavite and was a prominent figure in the group\'s successful province-wide motorcade and chapter founding assembly last Sunday. He is the second leader of the PM to be slain in almost three months, following the assassination of militant labor leader Ka Popoy Lagman last February 6. \r\n<P>\r\nThe group\'s Cavite chapter announced that it will launch mass actions to demand the immediate capture of the suspects and the swift resolution of the murder case.\r\n<P>\r\nAccording to PM national chairman Renato Magtubo, \"The perpetrators of this grisly act are undoubtedly enemies of the working class. Dark and sinister forces want to derail the PM as they are threatened by labor\'s active participation in mainstream politics.\r\n<P>\r\n\"While the slaying of Ka Popoy was meant to intimidate the PM, which was then in the heat of preparation for its National Founding Congress, the murder of Manuel Ibe intends to terrorize the PM Cavite chapter after its successful founding assembly.\"\r\n<P>\r\nMagtubo added, \"However, we will not be cowed. The party will persevere on its aims and objectives.\"\r\n<P>\r\nHe said, \"With barely a few days before Labor Day, militant labor leaders who sincerely strive for the interest of the working class in the parliamentary arena face the iron hand of repression and harassment. If government continuously fails to address this, labor will be forced to struggle through non-parliamentary means.\"\r\n<P>\r\nThe group decried the \"evolving pattern of repression against the PM\". Early this month, Reynaldo Lopez, PM organizer for Cavite was arrested. He was released after 3 days of incarceration. ###\r\n<P>\r\n\r\nPARTIDO NG MANGGAGAWA ONLINE: http://www.manggagawa.cjb.net\r\n<BR><BR><BR>','2001-05-01',605,28,0,0,'N','Email sent to info@vote.ph (4/24)','Murder of PM local leader',20010424163523);

Kung totohanang ilulunsad ng mahihirap ang Edsa 3, gawin natin ito para sa ating sariling interes at hindi para maibalik lang si Erap sa poder. \r\n<P>\r\n    Sa mga kapatid naming maralita, huwag nating hatiiin ang ating hanay sa pagitan ng pro-Gloria o pro-Erap. Tayo ay pare-pareho ng kapalaran bilang mahihirap. Pero kami ay naniniwala na ang ating katubusan ay wala kay Gloria o kay Erap. \r\n<P>\r\n    Maaring pareho ang ating damdamin na binigo ng dalawang Edsa ang mga mithiin ng mahihirap. Kami sa Sanlakas ay di rin kuntento na ang resulta ng Edsa Dos ay pag-akyat lang sa poder ni Gloria. Pero ang maglunsad ng Edsa 3 para lamang ibalik si Erap ay mas malaking trahedya. Si Erap ay nagkasala at dapat lang humarap sa hustisya.\r\n<P>\r\n    Kayat huwag nating ulitin sa ikatlong pagkakataon ang pagkakamali ng dalawang Edsa. Sa halip, hinangin natin ang pagkakaisa sa pagitan nating mahihirap para ipaglaban ang ating sariling interes - ang kapakanan ng mga mahihirap. Sa ganitong paraan, mas posible ang pagbabago kaysa manatili tayo sa pagpanig sa pagitan ni Erap at ni Gloria.  \r\n<P>\r\n    Kung gusto natin ng pababago, dapat nagkakaisa tayong kumilos para baguhin ang sistema ng ating bansa - ang pulitika sa ating bayan. Dapat nating likhain ang sariling lakas at kilusan laban sa lahat ng trapo sa ating bansa. Ang kapangyarihan ay dapat hawak nating mahihirap hindi ng mga gaya ni Gloria at ni Erap.\r\n<P>\r\n    Nananawagan din kami sa pamahalaan na huwag gumamit ng dahas sa protestang nagaganap sa Edsa. Karapatan ng mamamayan na maglunsad ng ganitong protesta, anuman ang kanilang paniniwala. \r\n<P>\r\n    Sa huli ay nagbibigay din kami ng babala kay Gloria na huwag balewalain ang namumuong daluyong ng masa sila man ay pro-Erap. Naniniwala kami na bukod sa kanilang simpatiya sa kanilang idolo ay naroon sa kanilang damdamin ang paghahanap ng totoong pagbabago.(30)\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>','2001-05-05',635,0,0,0,'Y','E-mail sent to info@vote.ph (4/29)','Kapangyarihan sa Masa ….',20010430080529);

During his term as Secretary, he crafted the Medium-Term Agricultural Development Plan (MTADP) and its four component programs for grains, livestock, key commercial crops, and fisheries. \r\n<P>\r\nThe MTADP is a cornerstone in the development of agriculture in the Philippines. In many ways, it is still recognized as the basis for the country\'s national agricultural development plan. The scheme was framed around the Key Production Area (KPA) approach, which imposed order on agricultural production by encouraging farmers to plant only those crops which are most suited to the services with precision - providing farmers with exactly the right kind of support when and where these services were needed. The result was a 3.2% increase in the gross domestic product for agriculture and fisheries in 1994 - a growth rate that had not been seen in agriculture for some years.\r\n<P>\r\nMr. Sebastian became the center of a controversial national issue in 1995, when a perceived rice crisis overwhelmed the country. He was widely blamed for refusing to import rice for the traditionally lean months of the year - an accusation to which Mr. Sebastian readily admits. He explains that regular importation is bad for local rice growers, and that he felt it was time for the Filipino people, most especially for government, to realize that self-sufficiency in rice is an imperative. \"We cannot always depend on importation to address the country\'s rice requirements,\" he said, \"The international trade in rice is too small and too volatile. There will come a time when the supply of rice in the world market will disappear totally. And what will happen to us then?\"\r\n<P>\r\nThe situation was aggravated when the National Price Coordinating Council imposed price controls on rice in Metro Manila. Although Mr. Sebastian had repeatedly explained that rice supplies are usually low during the third quarter of each year, the Council imposed the restrictions without the approval of the Department of Agriculture. The price ceiling prompted rice dealers to hoard their grain supplies - an act outlawed by the Constitution. As Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Sebastian took part in the government\'s efforts to stop unlawful hoarding. And on several occasions, he joined warehouse raids conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation.\r\n<P>\r\nThe controversy brought the issue of food security to the forefront of the national agenda. To resolve the matter, and to concretize the government\'s efforts to attain self-sufficiency in key food commodities, Mr. Sebastian undertook consultations with farmers, government officials, and businessmen all over the country in preparation for the declaration of a national food security program. The consultations culminated in a National Food Security Summit in January of 1996. Mr. Sebastian presided over the summit, in which the country\'s leaders affirmed a development program designed to attain self-sufficiency in rice and corn.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter his term as Secretary, President Fidel V. Ramos appointed Mr. Sebastian as Special Envoy and Ambassador to the World Trade Organization for Agricultural Affairs. Mr. Sebastian held the post until February of 1998, when Secretary Renato S. De Villa convinced him to run as Senator under the Partido Para Sa Demokratikong Reporma - Lapiang Manggagawa Coalition.','Manila','bukid@i-next.net','','227-2294',2,20010425110209,'','<B>Agricultural Strategies</B><BR>\r\n<P>\r\nIn pursuit of his vision and objectives, Roberto Sebastian has outlined a four-point reform strategy to ensure countryside development and agricultural growth, as follows: \r\n<P>\r\nReform and decentralize the budget process currently used by government so that development funds are devolved to local government units;\r\n<P>\r\nIncrease the budget allocation for the agriculture sector so that the small Filipino farmers and fisherfolk are provided with sufficient farm-to-market roads, ports, irrigation facilities, credit and other support services;\r\n<P>\r\nImplement a sound land use policy that transcends political boundaries and promotes the basic agricultural principle of planting the right crop at the right time and the right place while effectively protecting prime agricultural lands from conversion for purposes other than agriculture; and\r\n<P>\r\nReform the land reform program so those agrarian reform beneficiaries are not only given the right to own the land they till, but also the means to make productive use of this land.','Bobot','',0,0,'N');

Liban is a man of values and a family man, an exemplary father to his children Jing-Jing, Cheekee, Luzee, Kring-Kring and Carlo. He is a doting and devoted husband to his wife of 26 years, the former Marvina de Leon Reina of La Paz, Iloilo and Talipapa, Novaliches, Quezon City.\r\n<P>\r\nJing-jing is currently a graduating law student at the University of the Philippines.  Cheekee after obtaining her Child Psychology degree in UP is pursuing her medical studies at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.  Kring-kring is an incoming freshman who will take up Communications Technology Management.  Luzee is a 3rd year high school student while perky Carlo is a 6th grader.\r\n<P>\r\nHis wife, fondly called Baby by many has matched Liban’s devotion to his family with equal intensity. She gave up her post as vice president for a multinational firm in Makati City just to be able to devote her time attending to the needs of her family and her husband’s constituents. Now, Congressman and Mrs. Liban are busy devoting their lives answering the needs of the people. The successful tandem of Dante and Baby Liban only proves the truth of the dictum that behind the success of every man is a woman. Liban is also an active Catholic lay leader in Church through his membership in the Couples for Christ. He is a firm believer in the saying: \"No amount of success can ever compensate for failure in the home.\"','','','liban@pacific.net.ph','','932-9990; 428-5015',0,20010521155209,'','','','',61233,0,'N');

Papa Sito Sison was driving and Mama Sony Sison was seated at the back seat. Mama Sony said I was in a hurry to be born. When Papa saw my head coming out he parked the car near the Philippine General Hospital gate and rushed inside the hospital to get a doctor. Papa found a nurse who came out of the hospital with a tray to carry all 9 pounds of me. She cut the umbilical cord it was about 4 o\'clock in the morning of March the second.Papa Sito and Mama Sony did their best to bring up 8 children with the guidance of our Lord, with humor, perseverance, and family bonding together with their neighbors and other members of the Christian Family Movement.\r\n<P>\r\nI was fortunate to receive a Jesuit education from Fr. Candelaria, Fr. Galdon, Fr. Ferriols, Fr. Samson, Fr. Hofilena, Fr. Malasmas, Fr. Joe Cruz, Fr. Balchand, Fr. Lahiff, Fr. Miguel Bernad, Ms. Loreto Franco, Mrs. Badua, Mrs. Rilloraza, Mrs. Oledan, Ms. Adsuara, Mr. Guanzon, Mr.Gonzales, Mr.& Mrs. Palma, Mrs. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (now President of the Philippines), Fr. Macayan, Ms. Tendero. If I stayed longer than 16 years at the Ateneo de Manila I would have been a priest. Now I am a padre de pamilya, with two gregarious children, one teenager and the other wanting to be a teenager. \r\n<P>\r\nMy parenting style follows a democratic consultative and proactive approach. I do my best to make time for my wife Marge and our children, Ingrid Margaret and Paulo Luis. We listen to each other, we laugh and tell stories and we also pray together.

Believing that somehow, potential to accomplish great deeds is directly proportional to age. If that were true, then the first representative of CIBAC could not possibly exist. Joel Villanueva, all of 25 years old, has worked hard to make his mark in society. As the current managing director of ZOE TV Channel 11, Joel has been the moving force behind ZOE\'s thrust to provide quality programming for millions of viewers. In addition, he is the chairman of the Kristianong Kabataan Para Bayan (KKB) and the Ministry of HELPS, a socio-civic group providing assistance to calamity victims. He was also a recepient of the Gloria Macapagal Arroyo leadership Award in 1996 as well as a 2-time RP Youth member, representing the country in international basketball competitions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut perhaps his most laudable trait is that he does not find any reason to rest on his laurels. Instead, he has turned his attention towards the people\'s fight against a formidable foe - corruption. Joel is offering his youth and desire to rid the government of this scourge which has been thought by many skeptics as an unsolvable problem. A quixotic spirit in this young man? Perhaps.

Many seem to feel that these candidates simply make use of their popularity and their connections with media to catapult them into office without any real capacity to hold it. A skeptic would be quick about dismissing Kim as a CIBAC representative. Pretty, charming and outspoken, she could easily fit stereotypes made to show why media personalities should not be allowed to hold office. At least, on the surface, that is. It takes a closer look to reveal that Kim is actually be one of those who would actually insure a responsive, dynamic system of government that the people deserve. \r\n<P>\r\nKim Bernardo Lokin is a dedicated broadcast journalist who has steadfastly upheld her commitment to educate and inform the public on issues of national importance. For nearly a decade, Kim Bernardo-Lokin covered major news events enabling her to be familiar with key branches of government ---- Malacanang, Senate, Department of Justice and the NBI. As senior Senate reporter, Kim anchored ABS-CBN News Channel\'s Senate At Work from 1994-1995, giving the viewers a daily update of activities at the Upper House. \r\n<P>\r\nIn 1996, Kim was tapped to anchor the daily business program \"Stock Market Live\" also at the ABS CBN News Channel (ANC) a post she held for three years before getting her break as a primetime current affairs anchor of \"Moneywise\" a business magazine program which she hosted with Gilbert Remulla.','','','','',0,20010418103020,'','','','',0,0,'N');

If that is true, then CIBAC truly is fortunate. Its third candidate, Atty. Jess Martinez, not only has both, but also manages to get his ideals across in a very down-to-earth and affable manner.

HREF=\"http://www.ruffybiazon.com/profile.htm\">http://www.ruffybiazon.com/profile.htm</A>]\r\n<P>\r\nThe youngest of three children of Senator Rodolfo Biazon, Ruffy is not a newcomer in public service. \r\n<P>\r\nFrom his birth in Cavite Naval Station to his stay in Fort Bonifacio from less than a year old to his full maturity twenty three years later, he has seen and even been a part of countless civic action missions conducted by his father’s unit in the AFP. With his father’s strong leadership influence, he led similar activities in school, where he was actively involved in organizations and the student council. In the latter years of then General Biazon’s colorful career, Ruffy spent hours discussing with his father the intricacies of politics and public service, driven by the same fervor that characterized his writings in the school newspaper as an editor. \r\n<P>\r\nAfter high school, Ruffy dreamt of becoming a doctor with the noble intention of serving the people. As a pre-med course, he entered the University of Santo Tomas in and took up Medical Technology as a pre-med course. But fate had a different story for him. After his four years in UST, his life took a turn towards a different direction, although with the same objective---serving the people. \r\n<P>\r\nWhen he got out of college in 1991, he was appointed by then President Corazon Aquino to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Videogram Regulatory Board (VRB) representing the youth. Acting in a similar function as the MTRCB (Movie and Television Ratings and Classification Board), the VRB rates and classifies videogram materials, which are essentially those in video shops and video clubs. \r\n<P>\r\nWhen his father, then newly retired Chief of Staff of the AFP, first ran for senator  in 1992, he was appointed as Operations Director of the campaign organization. Although the campaign organization was not well funded and staffed by newcomers in politics, Ruffy was able draw up and implement and effective operations plan. As fate would have it, his father won a seat in the Senate. Immediately after that victory, Ruffy asked to organize the office due to his organizing skills, with the condition that he will continue on the medical school. But the exposure to being able to directly bring public service and the complexity of politics lured him to stay. \r\n<P>\r\nAs Chief of Staff of the Office of Senator Biazon, he practically was the right hand man of the senator. Aside from managing the daily administration of the office, he was also tasked to formulate projects for the Office’s public service programs. He was also the Chief Political Officer, to which he was delegated the task of liaising with other politicians, government agencies and private institutions. More importantly, he supervised the Legislative Staff, the group in the office that dealt with the primary task of a Senator---lawmaking. As such, he was responsible in leading the research and drafting of several important bills of the senator at that time such as the bill mandating the infusion of computer literacy subjects in all public elementary and high schools. \r\n<P>\r\nIn the 1995 elections, Ruffy was designated as Campaign Manager of Senator Biazon for his re-election bid. Although the campaign was effectively and efficiently run, the lack of campaign funds to match those spent by traditional moneyed politicians during the counting allowed Senator Biazon to be victimized by Dagdag-Bawas operators. For Ruffy, it opened an opportunity for him to go to Medical School. \r\n<P>\r\nBut as fate would have it, he was recruited by then newly-elected Senator Sergio Osmeña III to be his Chief Legislative Officer, tasked with heading the group which performed the lawmaking functions of the office. Ruffy used his previous experience to draw up an efficient team which became responsible in supporting Senator Osmeña in his legislative work. Landmark bills such as the Retail Trade Act and Public Services Act marked the output of the team. The investigation into the questionable Marconi Radar Contract was one of the important works of the team led by Ruffy which resulted into the cancellation of the contract. Another was the investigation into the series of sea tragedies which revealed the anomalies being done in the maritime agencies in the government. \r\n<P>\r\nTo prepare for Senator Biazon’s bid to return to the Senate in 1998, Ruffy resigned from the Office of Senator Osmeña in 1997 and prepared the groundwork for the campaign. Drawing on his organizing skills, political acumen and previous experience, Ruffy as Campaign Manager successfully steered the campaign of Senator Biazon to victory. \r\n<P>\r\nOnce again, Ruffy occupies the position of Chief of Staff of a senator’s office. More seasoned and mature this time around, he has taken on his role with much gusto. Once again, he has led the legislative staff of Senator Biazon to perform beyond the senator’s expectations. Effective management of human and material resources has brought about an effective and efficient office, with outputs surpassing those of other senators. \r\n<P>\r\nIn July of 2000, the Philippines played host to the 3rd Conference of the Global Parliamentarians on Habitat, an organization of parliamentarians and legislators from all over the world. Ruffy’s experience and skill in logistics management was once more tapped when he was appointed Director for Administration and Logistics of the conference secretariat. Without a hitch, the conference was conducted successfully, with more than 300 representatives from more than a hundred countries attending.  \r\n<P>\r\nBut the most important contribution of Ruffy to the senator’s office are the innovations and public service programs he has initiated. Being an avid information technology hobbyist (he is proficient in webpage design, computer graphics and multimedia applications), he has introduced computerization into the senator’s office making it one of the best equipped offices in the senate. He also provides the senator with insight on information technology, enabling the Senator to formulate proposals in the field of computerization. \r\n<P>\r\nBeing a resident of Muntinlupa, Ruffy formulated Compu.T.E.R.S. Project (Computer Training for Educators and Resources for Students Project) in Muntinlupa schools. Upon the recommendation of Ruffy, an initial amount of Three Million Pesos from Senator Biazon’s CDF was released for the purchase of computers for Muntinlupa National High School and Pedro E. Diaz High School and software training for the teachers. A second allocation amounting to Ten Million Pesos was released for the Compu.T.E.R.S. Project which would provide computers to all the four public high schools and fifteen public elementary schools plus software training for 740 public school teachers. Ruffy has also implemented an Internet Use Seminar for the students and teachers of Pedro Diaz High School, in preparation for the next project, the Internet Connection Project for high schools. \r\n<P>\r\nHaving gone around the country since 1992 delivering services in behalf of the senator, Ruffy has chosen to concentrate on the City of Muntinlupa. With his active participation in the legislative process since 1992, is knowledgeable about a wide range of issues, particularly those about information technology, education, public order and security, national defense, urban development and housing. \r\n<P>\r\nHis exposure in the Committee on Housing, Urban Planning and Resettlement which Senator Biazon chairs has given rise to his concern for those in the urban poor sector, particularly in Muntinlupa. He has formed MRB, Muntinlupa para sa Reproma at Bayanihan, a group that immerses itself in the urban poor communities of Muntinlupa and other sectors like the youth and the women, to get first hand information about the prevailing issues in those sectors to come up with legislative proposals that meet their needs. In addition, MRB has conducted numerous regular public service projects such as medical missions, water supply and support to activities of youth and community organizations. \r\n<P>\r\nHe has also initiated the “I Care for Day Care Project” of the Office of Senator Biazon, which benefits all 46 day care centers under the supervision of Muntinlupa Social Welfare Department. \r\n<P>\r\nIn his personal capacity, he is a director in ZONTAR Manpower Agency and Black Stallion Security Agency, both of which he is one of the incorporators.','','ruffy@ruffybiazon.com','8093132','0919-2015658',0,20010418130436,'','','Ruffy','',0,0,'N');

Rizal St., Sta. Elena, Marikina City<BR>\r\nMarried to: Concepcion Arguelles Panlilio<BR>\r\nChildren: Martin Nicolo P. de los Angeles<BR>\r\nPaolo Vicente P. de los Angeles  <BR>\r\n<P>\r\nCelso Gancayco de los Angeles, Jr. also known as “Boy Seseng” is the great grandson of the founder of the Shoe Industry, Laureano “Kapitan Moy” Guevara. He is a native Marikeno. His father, the late Dr. Celso Guevara de los Angeles or “Dr. Seseng” was a very much-loved physician in Marikina. He was one of the internationally well respected authorities in the field of pulmonary medicine. In Marikina, he was often referred to as “Doktor ng Bayan”. The mother of Boy Seseng is Purita Gancayco de los Angeles. She is still very active in the Catholic Women’s League, where she was the former National Director. She is also a trustee of the Sandigan Foundation. Boy Seseng’s grandfather on his father’s side, the late Don Servando Manahan de los Angeles ran for Congress in the 2nd district of the Province of Rizal.\r\n<P>\r\nMr. Celso G. de los Angeles, Jr., more popular known as “Boy Seseng” hailed from Marikina, the shoe capital of the Philippines. His Father, a dedicated physician was fondly called by his patients and friends as Dr. Seseng and his mother, Purita Gancayco de los Angeles who isstill living at their family house where he grew up in Brgy. Sta. Elena is known in the neighborhood as Dona Purita. The desire of his loving parents to provide him a better life in the future sent him to an exclusive school, Ateneo de Manila University where he completed his education from grade school to college. He pursued his studies and took up his Masters in Business Administration at the Asian Institute of Management, the country’s premier school in Management.\r\n<P>\r\nBoy Seseng has also his ups and downs but he believes that there is an opportunity in every crisis. He realized how much more persons can do it if they go beyond what appears to be their limits. “If you dreamed the best for yourself, you usually get,” as he often emphasized to his employees. His experiences in the USA for almost 14 years where he was even forced to apply as a security guard and as a gasoline attendant served as an inspiration and encouragement for his work force. And while working, he took time to study and finish a course in Free Legal Administration Management at Georgetown University in Washinton D.C.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 1996, when Mr. Celso G. de los Angeles, Jr. returned to the Philippines, he was welcomed by an offer to venture in the pre-need business and joined a fast growing educational plan company, Scholarship Plan Philippines Inc., as Chairman and CEO. Although he did not know the industry very well, he considered it as a challenge, and his financial expertise had gained him a firm base in this new endeavor. However, he realized that a one-product company does not only limit its market share but the profit margin as well and on December 5, 1998 Celso G. de los Angeles, Jr. acquired Legacy Plans Inc., as majority owner and launched the most competitive pension plan in the market.\r\n<P>\r\nAs a banker and a businessman, Mr. Celso G. de los Angeles, Jr., inspired by his great grandfather, Don Laureano “Kapitan Moy” Guevarra who set up the first shoe industry, has a special concern for the shoe industry and putting up a Marikina Shoe bank partly owned by shoe manufacturers and partly owned by the government is his most cherished dream. He stressed that shoemakers in Marikina if given the right support can craft shoes and accessories that could compete in the fashion centers of Paris, London, New Yorkm and Tokyo and even penetarate the global market.\r\n<P>\r\nHis outstanding performance attained through the years will serve as benchmarks for greater achievements ahead. His innovative management, pioneering efforts and the commitment to the business will surely lead to futher improve performance, set higher standards and enhance human resources capability particularly in the fields of marketing to face greater challenges and set the tone for the next millennium.','Marikina City','bosesnatin@hotmail.com','','6461575',2,20010508105210,'','','Boy Seseng','',0,0,'N');

During the turbulent years of \r\nhis stewardship at UP, he defended not only the State University’s tradition of \r\ndissent but also significantly improved its financial and human resources, Under \r\nhis term, UP established stronger links with the business community and alumni \r\norganizations, both locally and abroad.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>His achievements as UP President and active involvement in the \r\nCitizens watchdog group NAMFREL during the 1986 \"snap elections\" pushed him to \r\nnational prominence and mainstream politics. He placed 5<SUP>th</SUP> in the \r\nsenatorial election in 1987, the first free election after martial law.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>He was named \"No. 1 Senator\" of the 8<SUP>th</SUP> Congress by \r\nthe UP Institute of Strategic Development Studies. He was 3<SUP>rd</SUP> in the \r\n1992 senatorial elections and from 1993 to 1995, he served as Senate \r\nPresident.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>During Angara’s term as Senate President, the chamber was an \r\nactivist, reformist institution. He pushed hard for the passage of over 100 laws \r\nthat turned around the economy and laid down the environment for economic \r\ndynamism and growth. A new Philippine Central Bank was created, the banking \r\nsystem was liberalized, and infrastructure build up boosted the economy with the \r\nmassive entry of foreign investments.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>Also during his term as Senate President, Angara’s reformist \r\nbent was the sheer force that cut through the legislative gridlock to pass \r\nlandmark legislation.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>As a legislator, he was identified with landmark laws in \r\neducation, health, the arts , culture, and agriculture. He had a special concern \r\nfor the underclass, He was the principal author of the law granting free high \r\nschool education to all Filipinos. He authored the Magna Carta for Public Health \r\nWorkers. He also headed the congressional commission that turned out a landmark \r\ncomprehensive report on Philippine education. The report was the basis for the \r\nrestructuring of the education department and the on-going major reforms in the \r\neducational system.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>Two laws sponsored by Angara created the Commission on Higher \r\nEducation and Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and this \r\nenabled the education department to focus on its main concern – basic \r\neducation.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>He also sponsored the passage of the Agriculture, Fisheries and \r\nModernization Act which mandates the allocation of 120 billion pesos for the \r\nmodernization of the agricultural sector for a period of seven years.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>For those in the margin, Angara authored the Senior Citizens \r\nAct and the Breast Feeding Act. He co-authored the landmark Generics Drug Act \r\nand authored the law that provided a National Insurance Program for Filipinos \r\n(PhilHealth).</P>\r\n<P align=justify>A committed patron of the arts, he was the principal sponsor of \r\na law that created the new National Museum. A law he sponsored created the \r\nNational Commission on Culture and the Arts. The law on National Living \r\nTreasures bestows great honor on traditional and folk artists.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>As Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Angara had \r\nbeen the chief steward in increasing production, expanding markets, correcting \r\npolicy biases and promoting the cause of agriculture and fisheries.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>Frontier research work in agriculture research and development \r\nhad been another hallmark of Angara’s leadership at the DA. The great strides \r\nrecently achieved by the sector had been largely attributed to his \r\nleadership.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>Angara also became a solid voice in the fight for fair trading \r\nrules in global trade. He coined the phrase \"fair trade in a free trade context\" \r\nto dramatize the resolve of the developing countries to end the protectionist \r\nand unfair trade policies of developed countries. His bargaining with Australia \r\nover the entry of world-class fruits to that country’s market had been widely \r\nhailed in the country’s farming and trade circles.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>From a negative 6.6 percent performance in 1998, the \r\nagriculture sector had registered solid growths during the one year and a half \r\nAngara was secretary. The growth rate for the year 2000 was 3 percent. Palay \r\nproduction, according to field reports, was expected at 12.5 million metric \r\ntons, a historic record. The drive to gain self-sufficiency in rice, an elusive \r\ngoal, is about to become a reality, thanks to the production programs and \r\nsupport services initiated under his stewardship of the agriculture \r\ndepartment.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>In 1999, the sector posted a growth rate of 6.7 percent.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>The sector is expected to register a decent growth rate for the \r\ncurrent year.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>Having taken his oath on January 6, 2001 as Executive Secretary \r\nhe was responsible for the peaceful transition of the presidency from Estrada to \r\nArroyo, and the peaceful transition of power would not have been possible were \r\nit not for Angara and his unwavering commitment to serve his country until the \r\nvery end.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>Before joining the Estrada cabinet on May 25, 1999, he served \r\nas Chairman of the Philippine National Bank.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>He is married to Gloria Manalang, who was former chair of the \r\nCultural Center of the Philippines.

She annotated with the \r\nlatest Supreme Court decisions, all the major legal codes in the country.&nbsp; \r\nThe three new law books launched in mid-year were Constitution Annotated, Rules \r\nof Court Annotated and Penal Code Annotated.&nbsp; The books immediately hit the \r\nbestsellers’ list.&nbsp; Santiago later launched in December two more law books \r\nas part of the series, namely Civil Code Annotated and Local Government Code \r\nAnnotated. \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago launched her International Law (with Philippine Cases and \r\nMaterials and ASEAN Instruments).&nbsp; Santiago resided at Cambridge \r\nUniversity, as a 1999 Visiting Fellow of the Lauterpacht Research Center for \r\nInternational Law last summer where she was inspired at top speed to write her \r\ntreatise on international law. \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago delivered a privilege speech analyzing the criminal \r\nliability of Ramos and five of his cabinet secretaries for authorizing the \r\nrelease of P7 billion to propagandize the centennial celebrations.&nbsp; \r\nSantiago said the “smoking gun” in the proposed criminal case against former \r\npresident Fidel Ramos is the memorandum dated 27 February 1997 where Ramos \r\ndirected the executive departments to support from their 1997 budgets the \r\ncentennial celebration project.&nbsp; She charged that Ramos failed to comply \r\nwith the two conditions allowed by the Constitution for the transfer of \r\nappropriations, namely it should only be an augmentation and it should come from \r\nsavings.&nbsp; The Senate blue ribbon committee later released its report \r\nfinding Ramos and his cabinet secretaries liable for graft. The ex-president \r\nsuffered another crushing blow when the committee headed by Senator Rene \r\nSaguisag also found him guilty of graft. Santiago was instrumental in ensuring \r\nthat the highest public office will always be a public trust. \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago publicly disclosed the alleged practice of big-time casino \r\nVIPs of getting multi-million loans in state-owned casinos run by Pagcor which \r\nenables them to continue gambling even after they have lost all their \r\ncash.&nbsp; Santiago said that the government may have lost from P400 to P1 \r\nbillion, because of bouncing checks issued by casino VIPs.&nbsp; She stressed \r\nthat credit lines which remain unpaid for extended periods of time represent \r\nsubstantial revenue losses for the government. \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago introduced the country’s first and only legislative \r\ntraining program called Summer sa Senado.&nbsp; The program is designed to teach \r\nthe youth about legislation and gave them a hands-on training on drafting bills \r\nand resolutions.&nbsp; Students from the country’s top universities participated \r\nin the program and penned their own bills on different topics such as consumer \r\nrights, environment protection, and children’s rights.&nbsp; Santiago empowered \r\nthe youth by sponsoring the interns’ original bills in the Senate. \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago called for the speedy passage of her bill, “Code of \r\nProfessional Standards for Political Public Relations,” that seeks to \r\nprofessionalize the practice of political public relations and penalize bribery \r\nof media members in order to obtain preferential or guaranteed news or editorial \r\ncoverage. \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago voted for the Visiting Forces Agreement.&nbsp; Santiago \r\ncalled the VFA a “necessary imposition,” saying the Philippines needs to make a \r\nchoice between the US and Japan on the one hand, or China on the other \r\nhand.&nbsp; She said the Philippines should remain an ally of the US, because \r\nthe US “remains at the helm of the strongest network of military alliances in \r\nthe Asia-Pacific.” \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago delivered a statement at the United Nations General \r\nAssembly in Vienna, Austria, calling on the international community to consider \r\nthe adoption of the UN Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand \r\nReduction as a potent measure against drug manufacturing and trafficking. \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago interceded with the DOTC secretary to re-open the Iloilo \r\nCity Airport in time with the Dinagyang Festival scheduled for January 17 to 24, \r\n1999.&nbsp; Santiago urged the DOTC to speed up the maintenance work and repairs \r\nneeded for the airport runway. \r\n<P>· Filed the most number of bills and resolutions in the Senate, \r\nwith&nbsp;&nbsp; bills and&nbsp;&nbsp; resolutions.&nbsp; Delivered 12 privilege \r\nspeeches:&nbsp; Media Corruption in the National Elections, The Charter Change \r\nis Unconstitutional, The Proposed VFA is Void Ab Initio Because the Basis is \r\nUnconstitutional, A Congress Member has the Right to Resign, Taxpayer’s \r\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities well-intention, But..., The Constitution \r\nDoes Not Protect the Speech of Hate, Presidential Liability for P7 B Fund \r\nJuggling, The VFA in Constitutional and International Law, The VFA in the Law of \r\nBelligerency, The VFA in Contemporary International Relations, The P3.6 B Police \r\nDrug Test Deal is Grossly Disadvantageous to the Government, The Kingdom of \r\nDarkness, or the Empire that Government Contracts Built. \r\n<P>· Senator Santiago met 365 tricycle drivers of Philcoa in Quezon City where \r\nshe distributed sacks of rice as part of her outreach program. <BR>&nbsp; \r\n<P><B><FONT size=+1>LAWS PASSED, CO-AUTHORED BY SEN.

This tax expert from Harvard Law School was first recruited in 1966 to \r\nserve the government as Undersecretary of the Department of Finance. \r\nConcurrently, he held the chairmanship of the Monetary Board and acted as the \r\nInsurance Commissioner and Commissioner of Customs. He went on to occupy more \r\nkey positions in the government including the Department of Justice and \r\nDepartment of National Defense. His seventeen-year stint in the Defense \r\nDepartment was highlighted by his withdrawal of support for the twenty-year old \r\ngovernment of President Ferdinand Marcos, which led to the revolt that triggered \r\nthe historical People Power or EDSA Revolution. <BR><BR>\r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\n<B>FRUITFUL SENATORIAL STINT</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nExcellence undoubtedly marked his stay in the government while serving in \r\nvarious capacities. In 1987, he was the lone opposition Senator and thus \r\nprovided a constructive minority by being an effective fiscalizer to the new \r\nAquino government. In 1992, he won a seat in the House of Representatives by a \r\nlandslide representing the First District of Cagayan, his home province. He went \r\nback to the Senate in 1995 and chaired two powerful committees namely, \r\nGovernment Corporations and Public Enterprises, and Ways and Means. <BR><BR>As \r\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, he spearheaded the enactment \r\nof laws, which promote economic reforms by generating more income for the \r\ngovernment. In crafting these legislative measures, he stressed the importance \r\nof a simplified tax system so as not to make taxation more burdensome and \r\nonerous for the taxpaying public as well as promote efficiency in revenue \r\ncollection. To achieve this, he authored the following bills: \r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><B>Republic Act 8424 - Comprehensive Tax Reform Program</B> <BR><BR>SALIENT \r\nFEATURES: \r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>Exemption from tax of all income earned abroad by an Overseas Filipino \r\nWorker thus enabling the OFWs to save a substantial amount of their hard-earned \r\nincome for their families. \r\n<LI>Exemption from capital gains tax of proceeds realized from the sale of one\'s \r\nfamily home provided that said proceeds will utilized to acquire another \r\nresidential home. \r\n<LI>Substantial increase in personal exemption granted to individual taxpayers \r\nearning compensation income. \r\n<LI>Substantial increase in personal allowances granted to dependents of \r\nindividual taxpayers. </LI></OL><BR>\r\n<LI><B>SBN 2048 - An Act Exempting from Tax Certain Allowances and Benefits \r\nGranted to Members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)</B><BR><BR>\r\n<LI><B>SBN 2082 - An Act Exempting from Tax All Allowances and Benefits Granted \r\nto Public School Teachers</B><BR><BR>\r\n<LI><B>RA 8751 - An Act Providing Rules for Countervailing Duties on the \r\nImportation of Subsidized Products.</B> It has for its purpose the protection of \r\nlocal industries, which will be adversely affected by a massive importation of \r\nsubsidized products.<BR><BR>\r\n<LI><B>RA 8752 - An Act Providing the Rules for the Imposition of Anti-Dumping \r\nDuty.</B> Its purpose is to shield the local producers from the harsh effects of \r\nimportation of cheap dumped goods.<BR><BR>\r\n<LI><B>RA 8800 - An Act Providing Safeguards for Agricultural Products whose \r\nQuantitative Restrictions had been Replaced with Ordinary Customs Duties.</B> \r\nThis bill seeks to protect the agricultural sector from the flooding of low \r\nquality products imported from abroad.<BR><BR>\r\n<LI><B>SBN 2232 - An Act Elevating the Rank of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to \r\nthe level of a Collegiate Court with Special Jurisdiction.</B> This bill will \r\nenlarge the jurisdiction of the CTA and its organizational structure to promote \r\nefficient tax collection.<BR><BR>\r\n<LI><B>SBN 2208 - An Act Providing Optimum Performance in Revenue Collection \r\nthrough Lateral Attrition.</B> This bill grants special incentives and rewards \r\nfor exemplary service in revenue-generating agencies of the government.

Incisive legislative inquiries and well-documented public \r\nhearings were concluded in order to shed light on the following controversial \r\nissues: PEA-Amari Land Scam, Tax Credit Scam in the DOF and Purchase of Luxury \r\nVehicles by DECS Officials. <BR><BR>\r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\n<B>AS A SENATOR-JUDGE</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nHis fruitful stint in the Senate was marked with a genuine desire to serve the \r\npublic. This was again proven during the much-publicized impeachment trial of \r\nPresident Joseph Ejercito Estrada. As one of the Senator-Judges, the public \r\nmarveled at Senator Enrile\'s admirable display of legal expertise. As a lawyer \r\nwho has not lost a single case when he practiced law after passing the bar with \r\na perfect score in Commercial Law, he dutifully performed the gargantuan task of \r\nrendering impartial justice during the impeachment trial. His strong \r\ndetermination to uphold the Constitution earned him the sternest of rebuke from \r\nsome sectors that misunderstood the sincerity of his stand. <BR><BR>Every inch a \r\nseasoned statesman, Senator Enrile managed to regain the confidence of the \r\npeople when they realized the candor and honesty of his intentions. In the \r\nrecent SWS Survey, he landed in the magic 12, a feat that was elusive even to \r\nthose who figured prominently during the impeachment trial by joining the \r\nbandwagon. <BR><BR>This coming election, the public will again bear witness to \r\nan active demonstration of how democracy operates in the country by putting in \r\npower to only those candidates with proven competence, integrity and genuine \r\ndesire to serve the Filipino people. One such man is SENATOR JUAN PONCE ENRILE, \r\nwho stood up not only like a man, but also as an honorable statesman. <BR>','','','','[Source: <A HREF=\"http://www.juanponceenrile.com/profile-english.html\">http://www.juanponceenrile.com/profile-english.html</A>]<BR><BR>\r\n<P>\r\nOne such man grew up poor and out of wedlock and continues to influence world \r\nevents. His EDSA led revolt became a model for toppling repressive regimes all \r\nover the world. <BR><BR>Juan Ponce Enrile was born on Valentine\'s Day in a \r\nremote village in Cagayan. He was christened Juanito Furagganan, taking his \r\nmother\'s name. <BR><BR>Looking for better opportunities, the young Juanito left \r\nGonzaga, Cagayan for the poblacion and enrolled in school by working as a \r\nservant to his mother\'s relative. <BR><BR>He later transferred to Aparri and \r\nenrolled at the Cagayan Valley Institute. <BR><BR>World War II broke out and \r\nJuanito, now a young man joined the guerillas. He was caught, imprisoned and \r\ntortured. He escaped, and at the end of the war, was serving in the U.S. \r\nQuartermaster depot in Aparri, Cagayan. <BR><BR>While the war was raging, his \r\nhalf sisters evacuated to Aparri and learned about Juanito. <BR><BR>After the \r\nwar, Juanito met his father in the latter\'s Law Office in Binondo, Manila. \r\n<BR><BR>Don Alfonso brought Juanito home to Malabon. He was given a new name, \r\nJuan Ponce Enrile. He resumed his High School education at the St. James Academy \r\nin Malabon. <BR><BR>In 1947, he entered Ateneo de Manila graduating cum laude \r\nwith an Associate in Arts Degree. In the UP, he graduated cum laude and \r\nsalutatorian of UP Law Class 1953. He later passed the Bar Examinations placing \r\n11th with a 91.72% rating and getting a perfect score in commercial law. \r\n<BR><BR>He was offered a scholarship by the Harvard University where he earned a \r\nMaster of Laws degree specializing in taxation and corporate reorganization. \r\n<BR><BR>Returning to the Philippines, he joined the Ponce Enrile, Siguion Reyna, \r\nMontecillo, Bello Law Office where he emerged as a top corporate and litigation \r\nlawyer. He never lost a case. <BR><BR>In 1966, he was appointed as \r\nUndersecretary of Finance, acting Insurance Commissioner of Customs and acting \r\nChairman of the Monetary Board. In 1968-70 he served as Secretary of Justice. He \r\nwas appointed Secretary of National Defense in 1970, a position he held for \r\nalmost seventeen (17) years until 1986. <BR><BR>He became an Assemblyman of \r\nCagayan in 1978 and was reelected in 1984. <BR><BR>The events of February 1986 \r\nmarked turning point in the history of the Philippines and in Enrile\'s career. \r\nFollowing the turbulent snap elections of February 7,1986, and amid the \r\nprolonged crisis that gripped the country after the assassination of former \r\nSenator Benigno Aquino, Jr., Enrile withdrew his support for the Marcos \r\ngovernment and led the revolt that triggered what would be known as the People \r\nPower or EDSA Revolution. <BR><BR>Together with a handful of officers and men, \r\nhe rallied the ranks of the Philippine military behind the rebellion, which \r\nculminated in the fall of the Marcos government. <BR><BR>It was during this time \r\nthat hundreds of thousands of citizens poured into EDSA (Epifanio Delos Santos \r\nAvenue) and for four days surrounded the camp where Enrile and his men were \r\nholding out, thus averting a bloody confrontation between the rebels and Marcos \r\nloyalist group in the military. <BR><BR>Mrs. Corazon Aquino, who was proclaimed \r\nthe New President, reappointed Enrile as Secretary of National Defense. He the \r\npost after six months, however, as differences over policy with the new \r\nadministration grew. <BR><BR>In 1987, he ran and won as opposition Senator. \r\nSubsequently, was the lone opposition Senator in the Senate. As Minority Floor \r\nLeader, he was a member of all the standing committees of the Senate. He was \r\nalso a member of the Senate Electoral Tribunal and the Commission on \r\nAppointments. <BR><BR>In the May 11, 1992 elections, he won a seat in the House \r\nof Representatives by a landslide representing the First District of Cagayan, \r\nhis home province. He joined the Liberal Party, to which his father belonged, \r\nshortly after. <BR><BR>In the May 1995 elections he ran and won a seat once \r\nagain in the Senate under the Lakas Coalition. Again he was a member of the \r\nCommission on Appointments and Chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee \r\nand the Committee on Government Corporations and Public Enterprises. <BR><BR>At \r\nthat time, he authored the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program, which eventually \r\nbecame Republic Act 8424. Among the inclusions that would greatly benefit the \r\nOverseas Filipino Worker in this law is the exemption of their income earned \r\nabroad from taxation, thus enabling them to save a more substantial amount from \r\ntheir salaries for their families. In addition to this, is the exemption from \r\ncapital gains tax, proceeds realized from the sale of one\'s family home provided \r\nthat such gains would be utilized to acquire another residential home. \r\n<BR><BR>During the 10th and 11th Congress, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile filed \r\nseveral legislative landmarks namely: the; SB No. 2068 which seeks to increase \r\nby at least 100% the personal and additional tax exemptions granted to \r\nindividual income tax payers; SB. No. 2089 which seeks to reduce the income tax \r\nrates on taxable income; SB 1887 which would allow the deductibility from \r\ntaxable income of interest payments on housing loans, and in addition, SB No. \r\n2082 which seeks to exempt all the allowances and benefits granted to public \r\nschool teachers, including those in state colleges and universities from income \r\ntax. <BR><BR>He has gone on to serve as one of the most productive and \r\noutstanding senators in the present Congress. <BR><BR>He has continued to serve \r\nas he has lived- with excellence, determination and desire to serve the Filipino \r\npeople. <BR>','Gonzaga, Cagayan','','','',2,20010531112842,'','[Source: <A HREF=\"http://www.juanponceenrile.com/legislative-agenda.html\">http://www.juanponceenrile.com/legislative-agenda.html</A>]<BR><BR>\r\n<P>\r\nI consider the following as the top priorities for the nation included in my \r\nlegislative agenda as Senator of the Philippines should I be fortunate enough to \r\nbe re-elected as Senator this coming elections: <BR><BR><B>THE ECONOMY</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nWe have to calibrate carefully the exchange rate so that we neither price \r\nourselves out of the world market nor allow the peso to depreciate. An \r\nacceptable exchange rate must be determined in relation to our neighbors and our \r\ncompetitors. With respect to interest rates, I advocate the policy of fostering \r\ncompetition - not regulation - to bring down interest rate levels. I will \r\ndirectly compete with the commercial banks by providing credit lower rates. \r\n<BR><BR>I have long ago taken the position that we must reduce the tax burden on \r\nthe people. Primarily, I am advocating this as a creative way of increasing the \r\nfree or disposable income of taxpayers and spurring economic activity. \r\n<BR><BR>We must realize that no matter how much we press for salary increases, \r\nemployers are hardly in a position, especially given the economic situation, to \r\ngive their employees the substantial wage increase they need to cope with the \r\nrise in cost of living. A cut in taxes will automatically increase the take home \r\npay of our salaried employees and thus enable them to buy more goods. The \r\neconomy will benefit in turn from increased spending and economic activity. \r\n<BR><BR>During the last Congress, I filed two related bills aimed at achieving \r\nthis goal to wit, Senate Bill No. 2068 which seeks to increase the allowable \r\npersonal and addition exemptions of individual taxpayers by at least 100%; and \r\nSenate Bill No. 2089 aimed at reducing the corresponding tax rates of individual \r\ntaxpayers by at least 50%. Public hearings for the passage of this bill were \r\nheld and the corresponding Committee Reports were prepared. I even went to the \r\nextent of sponsoring it in the Senate before we adjourned. <BR><BR>Moreover, to \r\nfurther protect the consuming public from the predatory practices of some \r\nunscrupulous businessmen, I will pursue the enactment of an Anti-Trust Law that \r\nwill check and penalize any act or practice that will in one way or the other \r\nresult in any combination or monopoly in restraint of trade. <BR><BR>If \r\nre-elected, I vow to pursue these and other measures aimed at reducing the tax \r\nburden on the people so that they can have more money in their hands for their \r\nbasic needs. <BR><BR><B>PEACE AND ORDER</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nI advocate the return of jurisdiction and control over the police to the local \r\ngovernments. Nationalizing the police has only turned the law enforcement effort \r\ninto a bureaucratic mess. We should maintain a national constabulary at a \r\nnational level to attend to peace and order problems that are national in \r\nnature. <BR><BR><B>GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nI advocate the following: \r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>Adoption of the generalized civil service system of the British Civil \r\nService, in lieu of our present compartmentalized system. Under that system, a \r\ncivil servant is considered as an employee of the entire government service not \r\nof specific departments or agencies. Thus, he or she can be easily moved from \r\none department to another. \r\n<LI>Review of the entire government bureau so as to remove duplication of \r\nagencies and services to make the government not only less wasteful but more \r\nefficient as well. \r\n<LI>Restoration of the full powers of the Commission on Appointments of Congress \r\nunder which all officials of the bureaucracy down to assistant director level \r\nmust pass the scrutiny of the Commission. This will help arrest profusion of \r\npolitical appointments to the civil service. \r\n<LI>Abolition of the Judicial and Bar Council, which at present recommends to \r\nthe President appointments to the courts. </LI></UL><B>EDUCATION</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nTo achieve high-quality education, we should focus attention on the three areas \r\nwhere reform can result in positive change for our society: \r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>The quality of teachers and teacher training; \r\n<LI>The physical facilities of our institutions of learning; and \r\n<LI>The substance of the curriculum. </LI></UL>During the past Congress, I filed \r\nseveral Senate Bills that will boost our education system into the new \r\nmillennium. An example of which concentrates on information technology (IT) \r\neducation since the IT industry is the wave of the future. Another bill proposes \r\nto exempt the allowances granted to public school teachers from taxation to \r\nentice more people to join the academe. <BR><BR>We must also create more State \r\nColleges and Universities so that more Filipino students may be given the \r\nopportunity to enroll at a low cost. <BR><BR>If re-elected, I shall continue to \r\npursue my vision for Education by re-filing these bills, file other related \r\nmeasures and work on the passage of the same. <BR><BR><B>NATIONAL SECURITY</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nI wholly support the modernization of our armed forces. What we need are modern \r\nweapon systems. Because we do not have all the available resources for full AFP \r\nmodernization, we should set priorities. Between the Navy and the Air Force, I \r\nbelieve we should pour resources into the Navy because we are an archipelagic \r\nnation. <BR><BR><B>FOREIGN RELATIONS</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nWe should nurture our membership in ASEAN and other Asian forums; APEC and our \r\nrelations with countries like the United States of America, Canada, Australia \r\nand Latin America. Our ties with Europe and the Middle East are of vital \r\nimportance as well particularly in terms of trade and investment. We must strive \r\nto contribute our share to the work of the United Nations, of which the \r\nPhilippines is a founding member. <BR><BR><B>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM</B> \r\n<HR width=\"100%\" SIZE=1>\r\nI believe we should face, once and for all, the challenge of amending our \r\nConstitution. Among the reforms that I consider urgent are the following: \r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>The desynchronization of elections; \r\n<LI>The election of senators by regions; \r\n<LI>The review of the terms of office of all elective officials of the \r\ngovernment; \r\n<LI>The return of supervision and control of the police to the local \r\ngovernments; \r\n<LI>The restoration of the full powers of the Commission on Appointments to \r\nreview presidential appointments; \r\n<LI>The transfer of court supervision from the Supreme Court to the Department \r\nof Justice as provided for in the 1935 Constitution; \r\n<LI>The creation of a two-party system; and \r\n<LI>The re-examination of the constitutional provisions governing the economy \r\nand private ownership. </LI></UL>','JPE','',9237333,2,7212000,'N',584571,312404,820178,1472156,279188,438280,148348,169572,143883,320732,606902,148062,134162,0,515709,235247,321);

He landed third \r\nplace among the twelve elected senators and first among the neophyte candidates. \r\nOnce again the Filipino people elected a Magsaysay to be one of their leaders in \r\ngovernment. They trusted the integrity of the son of their beloved President to \r\ncontinue the legacy of serving the cause of the common man.</P>\r\n<P class=newstitle>J.O.B.S.</P>\r\n<P class=newstext>In the Senate, Jun Magsaysay worked within the objective of \r\nproviding opportunities that would help improve the living conditions of the \r\nordinary Filipino. His program of government is summarized as \'<B>J.O.B.S.</B>\', \r\nthe acronym for Jobs, Opportunities, Business and Security. The laws he helped \r\nenact were geared toward expanding business and employment opportunities, \r\npromoting national unity and security.</P>\r\n<P class=newstitle>Quest for Moral Governance</P>\r\n<P class=newstext>On October 12, 2000, five months before he is to embark on a \r\nre-election bid, Magsaysay resigned from the administration coalition to support \r\nthe people\'s call for the President\'s resignation. His decision to sever ties \r\nwith the administration came in light of clamor for moral governance, with Jun \r\nMagsaysay believing that the President has &amp;quot;lost his moral authority to \r\ngovern the nation&amp;quot;. Once again, Magsaysay had shown that he is ready to \r\nturn his back on a powerful machinery that would have ensured his political \r\nsurvival, in exchange for a reformed and morally upright government.</P>\r\n<P class=newstitle>Mission to Carry on the Legacy</P>\r\n<P class=newstext>Indeed, President Ramon Magsaysay\'s commitment to the \r\nFilipinos did not die with him in that tragic plane crash. His son, Jun \r\nMagsaysay, is living proof that the Filipino people have not entirely lost a \r\ngreat leader, he left behind a son to carry on the legacy.</P>','Manila','','','',2,20010531112842,'','','Jun','',10794941,1,8505158,'N',766343,173870,1204381,1261041,531295,1044442,372306,127899,153399,293513,459032,71352,205735,0,598921,317044,171);

Hence, Dong Puno is in favor of a \r\ncloser cooperation between the Executive Branch and Congress in shifting the \r\nbulk of the education budget from tertiary to basic education. To correct the \r\ncurrent education job mismatch, he is for selecting - and further developing - \r\nCenters of Excellence from among the existing educational institutions in each \r\nregion and province.

He will also back measures to \r\nimprove the Philippine capability to supply qualified workers in the area of \r\ninformation technology or IT. There is also the problem of providing retraining \r\nfor overseas workers, many of whom want to return home but are prevented from \r\ndoing so by the lack of opportunities back home. To improve opportunities for \r\nacquiring low-cost homes, he also supports a government policy designed to \r\nsustain a demand-driven approach to housing. The supply driven policy in the \r\npre-Estrada era resulted in costly mistakes that we should not repeat. He is for \r\ndevelopment of resettlement for squatters that include not only adequate basic \r\nservices but also livelihood opportunities. N - No to drugs The drug problem is \r\nnow very serious. Dong Puno supports taking a firm stand against drug \r\ntrafficking and dealing a hard blow against those involved in the supply side of \r\nthis scourge.

The perception of some that the courts are a \r\nmarket place where life and liberties are traded to the highest bidder must be \r\nreversed.

Thus, Dong Puno \r\nwill support programs and policies that promote sustainable development and at \r\nthe same time provide jobs and alternative livelihood opportunities for sectors \r\nthat may be displaced or adversely affected as a result of these initiatives. \r\nSustainable development should meet the requirements of the present generation \r\nof Filipinos without endangering the capacity of future generations to meet \r\ntheir own needs. Dong Puno also believes that now is the time for Government to \r\ncome up with a realistic program to finally deal with our forest denudation. He \r\nwill spearhead a drive in the Senate so that Congress can pass legislation that \r\nwill resolve the problem of deforestation and allow reasonable commercial \r\nactivities to ensure the welfare of dependents in wood-based industries, upland \r\ndwellers and other affected sectors. He believes that due regard should also be \r\ngiven to the legitimate concerns of responsible loggers who have a clear and \r\nsustained reforestation program in place.

The \r\nspate of land conversion and even the conversion of forested areas into \r\nalienable and disposable lands have been done at the whim of local government \r\nunits and even Congress.

While the matter \r\nis now with the courts, I am of the position that Congress, as a policy-making \r\nbody, can and should, once and for all, declare the fund as public to finally \r\ngive our the small coconut farmers what is due them in terms of concrete \r\nprojects and programs that will modernize and develop the sector and push \r\nR&amp;D to the limits as the industry, I maintain, has a lot of \r\npotential</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>3. Absentee Voting for \r\nOverseas Filipinos - When I was still Senator of the 9th Congress, I already \r\nfiled a bill to put this into law but up to now, we\'re already on the 11th \r\nCongress, it still remains a bill. Overseas voting by qualified Filipinos is \r\nactually mandated by the Constitution, to wit: \"Congress shall provide a system \r\nfor securing the secrecy and sanctity of the ballot as well as a system for \r\nabsentee voting by qualified Filipinos abroad.\" (Sec. 2, Article V) I believe \r\nthat our OFWs are among the most educated among our citizens. If we are to break \r\naway from the traditional patronage politics, OFWs whose main concerned would be \r\nto come home and be united with their families, will most likely contribute to a \r\nmore enlightened electoral exercise </FONT></P>','[Source: <A HREF=\"http://www2.tanada.net/bobby/profile2.html#educ\">http://www2.tanada.net/bobby/profile2.html#educ</A>]<BR><BR>\r\n<TABLE BORDER=\"0\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD vAlign=top  colSpan=6 height=20></TD></TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD width=22 height=20></TD>\r\n<TD vAlign=top  colSpan=6 height=20>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial color=#0000a0 size=3>CONGRESSMAN</FONT><FONT face=Arial \r\ncolor=#ff0000 size=3> </FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>(4th \r\nDistrict, Quezon Province)</FONT><FONT color=#000000><BR><FONT face=Arial \r\nsize=2>July 01, 1995-June 30,1998</FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>July \r\n01, 1998- to present</FONT> </FONT></FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#0000a0><FONT size=3>SENATOR</FONT></FONT><FONT \r\ncolor=#ff0000 size=2> </FONT><FONT color=#000000><FONT size=2>Republic of the \r\nPhilippines</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>July 1, 1987 - June, 30, 1995</FONT> \r\n</FONT></FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial color=#0000a0 size=3>PRESIDENT</FONT><FONT face=Arial \r\ncolor=#ff0000 size=3> </FONT><BR><FONT color=#000000><FONT face=Arial \r\nsize=2>Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM)</FONT><BR><FONT \r\nface=Arial size=2>1999</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#0000a0><FONT size=3>CHAIRMAN</FONT></FONT> \r\n</FONT><BR><FONT color=#000000><FONT face=Arial size=2>Philippine Working Group \r\nfor an ASEAN Human Rights Mechanism </FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial><FONT \r\nsize=2>1999</FONT> </FONT></FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#0000a0><FONT size=3>MEMBER</FONT></FONT> \r\n</FONT><BR><FONT color=#000000><FONT face=Arial size=2>Judicial Bar \r\nCouncil</FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>1987 - 1991</FONT> \r\n</FONT></FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#0000a0><FONT size=3>COMMISSIONER</FONT></FONT> \r\n</FONT><BR><FONT color=#000000><FONT face=Arial size=2>Bureau of \r\nCustoms</FONT><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>March 07, 1986 - \r\nMarch 06, 1987</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#0000a0><FONT size=3>PARTNER</FONT></FONT> \r\n</FONT><BR><FONT color=#000000><FONT face=Arial size=2>Tañada, Vivo &amp; Tan \r\nLaw Offices</FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>1970 - To Present</FONT> \r\n</FONT></FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial color=#0000a0 size=3>BAR EXAMINER </FONT><BR><FONT \r\nface=Arial><FONT color=#000000><FONT size=2>1978</FONT></FONT> </FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><FONT face=Arial color=#0000a0 size=3>LAW PROFFESOR</FONT><FONT face=Arial \r\ncolor=#0000ff> </FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>Manuel L.

At a very young age, he was already helping his mother sell \r\nshrimp and fish in the Divisoria market. \r\n<P>\"I learned from my mother what it takes to be an entrepreneur,\" he revealed. \r\n\"And it means to work really hard to achieve your dreams.\" In Divisoria, he \r\nmarvelled at the volumes of sales the Chinese merchants were making and vowed \r\nearly on to become an entrepreneur. \r\n<P>Manny Villar was a working student at the University of the Philippines, the \r\npremier institution of higher learning in the country, where he obtained his \r\nundergraduate and masters degree in business administration and accountancy. By \r\nthen, he was already putting in long hours as a fish and shrimp trader where the \r\naction starts at the ungodly hours of the early morning when the catch lands on \r\nthe market. \r\n<P><STRONG><FONT face=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Early \r\nentrepreneurship</FONT> </STRONG>\r\n<P>After graduation, he tried his hand as an accountant at the country\'s biggest \r\naccounting firm, Sycip Gorres and Velayo (SGV), but resigned shortly to embark \r\non his own seafood delivery business. It was then that his innovative business \r\nmind was already apparent. \r\n<P>When a restaurant he was delivering stocks to did not pay him, he printed out \r\n\"meal tickets\" which he persuaded the restaurant owners to honor. He then sold \r\nthese tickets at a discount to office workers. It took him one whole year to \r\nliquidate his receivables. \r\n<P>With his business down, he worked briefly as a financial analyst at the \r\nPrivate Development Corporation of the Philippines. His job was to sell World \r\nBank loans but despite the attractive rates there were no takers. Convinced that \r\nhe could make a go on his own again, he quit his job and promptly applied for \r\none of the loans. \r\n<P>So with P10,000 initial capital in 1975, Villar bought two reconditioned \r\ntrucks and started his sand-and-gravel business in Las Piñas. Las Piñas then was \r\nin the throes of a construction boom as one of the premier residential suburbs \r\nsouth of Manila. \r\n<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><FONT face=verdana size=-1>Housing \r\ninnovator</FONT></FONT></STRONG> \r\n<P>It is here while delivering construction materials to big developers that \r\nManny Villar came upon the idea of selling house-and-lot packages when the \r\nconvention then was for homebuyers to buy lots and build on them. \r\n<P>When developers were offering 240 sqm. lots, he started to build houses at \r\n120 sqm. at very affordable prices. He priced his offerings within the range of \r\ngovernment-provided loans so that homebuyers need not fork out a large equity. \r\nAnd even with the equity requirement, he came out with in-house financing backed \r\nwith a \"second mortgage\" on the house (the first mortgage being with the \r\nprincipal loan giver) so that homebuyers can immediately move in. \r\n<P>His projects sold like hotcakes he became a millionaire at only 26 years old. \r\n\r\n<P>He then initiated mass housing projects to achieve economies of scale and \r\nintroduced development projects within existing subdivisions by buying off their \r\nrights of way. His various innovations practically created the country\'s mass \r\nhousing industry the Philippine Center of Investigative Journalism calls him \r\n\'the dean of the [Philippine] real estate industry.\" \r\n<P><STRONG><FONT face=verdana size=-1></FONT><FONT color=#003366><STRONG><FONT \r\nface=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Staying in the country</FONT></STRONG> \r\n</FONT></STRONG>\r\n<P>By the mid-1980s, in the aftermath of the economic crisis spawned by the \r\nAquino Assasination, Villar consolidated his business and collected on his \r\nreceivables. Other big developers, on the other hand, continued on their \r\nbusiness expansion. When the crunch came with the deep devaluation of the peso, \r\nmany big developers collapsed while Villar was busy buying rawlands at give-away \r\nprices. \r\n<P>Villar recalled that many developers then just packed their bags and left the \r\ncountry in the aftershocks of the crisis. But he stayed on and believed in the \r\ncountry\'s eventual recovery. \"I was seeing the big taipans like Henry Sy \r\nbuilding this biggest mall in the country and Lucio Tan and John Gokongwei all \r\nexpanding. I said to myself that if I\'m wrong then at least I\'m in their \r\ncompany.\" \r\n<P>With a traditional market shrinking, he began to offer his projects to \r\noverseas contract workers who were then awash with cash after the peso \r\ndevaluation. Overseas workers first bought small appliances from Henry Sy\'s SM \r\nMalls to fuel surging consumer demand. After which, they started to buy the big \r\nticket item from Manny Villar\'s Camella and Palmera Homes. \r\n<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><FONT face=verdana size=-1>Bi</FONT>ggest \r\nhomebuilder</FONT></STRONG> \r\n<P>When the economy bounced back with the assumption of the Aquino government, \r\nVillar was already holding an extensive landbank which became the foundation of \r\nhis housing empire. \"I continued in housing development seeing that I\'m the only \r\none left in the business,\" he said. \"Housing, after all, is a fundamental need.\" \r\n\r\n<P>By 1995, when he listed his holding company C&amp;P Homes at the stock \r\nexchange, he was already holding more than 2,000 hectares of prime lands and had \r\nalready built more than 100,000 homes to become the biggest homebuilder in \r\nSoutheast Asia. \r\n<P>For his business achievements, he was made cover story in the Far Eastern \r\nEconomic Review and his life story featured in Asiaweek, Forbes, AsiaMoney and \r\nAsian Business Review. \r\n<P><STRONG><FONT face=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Public \r\nservice</FONT>&nbsp;</STRONG> \r\n<P>In 1992, Manny Villar entered another turn in his career when he decided to \r\nrun for congressman in the lone district of Las Piñas and Muntinlupa. \"Going \r\ninto public service,\' he said, \'seems natural because my business, low-cost \r\nhousing, has a social dimension. It is a form of public service to make housing \r\naffordable to many of our people.\" \r\n<P>In a stunning political debut, Villar won with the most overwhelming mandate \r\namong Metro Manila congressmen. He promptly applied his economic and managerial \r\nexpertise as a key member of the House\'s economic team, marshaling in economic \r\nreforms measures of the Ramos Administration such as the New Foreign Investments \r\nAct and the restructuring of the Central Bank of the Philippines. He was the \r\nHouse representative in the government\'s negotiations with the International \r\nMonetary Fund in Washington, D.C., in 1992. \r\n<P>He also oversaw various infrastructure projects in his districts like \r\nconcreting of numerous roads and building the Alabang-Zapote Flyover. He \r\nintroduced the \"Friendship Route\" to alleviate the traffic problem in southern \r\nManila by persuading subdivision homeowners to open up their roads to the \r\ngeneral public. \r\n<P>He succeeded in passing Republic Act 8003, Declaring Certain Areas in Las \r\nPiñas as Tourist Spots. The law formalized his program of rehabilitating \r\nhistorical and cultural landmarks in Las Piñas starting with the world-famous \r\nBamboo Organ and Church. The on-going project, dubbed \"Las Piñas Historical \r\nCorridor\" covers the stretch of the Old District and may even rival the \r\nIntramuros and Vigan restoration projects. \r\n<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><FONT face=verdana size=-1></FONT><STRONG><FONT \r\nface=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Committed environmentalist</FONT></STRONG> \r\n</FONT></STRONG>\r\n<P>A staunch environmentalist, he initiated his own privately-funded tree \r\nplanting drive in his district. He developed a P10 million tree nursery besides \r\nhis home and has quietly undertaken a dedicated tree-planting drive, complete \r\nwith maintenance and watering of tree seedlings planted in the open spaces of \r\nthe community. \r\n<P>During his first term, he steered Muntinlupa to cityhood to be followed by \r\nLas Piñas the following term. He pointed out: \"As a developer, I have always \r\nenvisioned these two communities as the \'Twin Cities of the South\' of Manila. In \r\nfact, Las Piñas and Muntinlupa are the two fastest growing communities in the \r\ncountry today.\" \r\n<P>In 1995, Manny Villar ran for re-election and won an unprecedented 142,000 \r\nvotes, the highest number of votes for a congressman in the entire country. \r\nWinning media acclaim as outstanding congressman and the respect and recognition \r\nof his peers, he was elected to chair the Committee on Entrepreneurship. \r\n<P>As one of the leading entrepreneurs in the country, he championed the cause \r\nof small and medium enterprises. He authored and passed into law the landmark \r\nNew Magna Carta for Small and Medium Enterprises (RA 8289). He initiated \r\ncreative legislation such as establishment of the Small and Medium Enterprises \r\nStock Exchange and Business One-Stop-Shop centers. \r\n<P>By the end of his second term of office, Villar had already proven beyond \r\ndoubt his capacity for excellence as a true Filipino entrepreneur and a \r\nbrilliant public servant who can get things done. \r\n<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><FONT face=verdana size=-1></FONT><STRONG><FONT \r\nface=verdana color=#003366 size=-1>Speaker of the House \r\n</FONT></STRONG></FONT></STRONG>\r\n<P>It was no surprise then to those in the know during his third term of office \r\nwhen he gained the remarkable acclaim of 171 of 220 congressmen as the Speaker \r\nof the 11th Congress of the House of Representatives. \r\n<P>In a time when the country is slowly recovering from a host of economic and \r\npolitical crises, the election of the \'brown taipan\' at the helm of Congress \r\nsignaled a watershed event in Philippine political history. The rise of Manny \r\nVillar ushered in a new consensus of leadership based on managerial skills and \r\nnot simply on oratory and rhetoric. \r\n<P>By his first year of office, Villar undertook three pathbreaking reforms. In \r\nsupport of President Joseph Ejercito Estrada\'s call, he succeeded first in \r\nmarshaling consensus in the House to reform the \'pork barrel\' system by limiting \r\ncongressional discretion projects to the set parameters of the Executive\'s \r\ndevelopment policies. Second, he launched a revamp of leadership by appointing \r\nat least seven neophyte congressmen to head powerful committees like ecology and \r\nbanks. Finally, he set a strong and principled stance on environmental \r\nprotection legislation with the passage of the Clean Air Act, a measure three \r\nprevious congresses for more than ten years were not able to pass. \r\n<P>On his second year in office, Manny Villar steered the 11th Congress into a \r\nrecord-breaking achievement in legislation and economic reforms. Among the \r\npathbreaking measures he shepherded into law were the Retail Trade \r\nLiberalization Act, the New Central Bank Act, the New Securities Code, and the \r\nNew Banking Act. But it was on the third month during his third year in office \r\nthat Villar made his indelible mark on the country\'s history. \r\n<P><STRONG><FONT color=#003366><STRONG><FONT face=verdana color=#003366 \r\nsize=-1>Defining moment</FONT></STRONG> </FONT></STRONG>\r\n<P>Beyond being a super achiever in business and politics, Manny Villar seized \r\nthe entire nation\'s attention and inspiration when single-handedly, bearing the \r\nfull responsibility of his decision, he showed the Filipino people what true \r\npolitical leadership and craftmanship means, by sending President Estrada\'s \r\nimpeachment articles straight to the Senate, brooking no interruption or delay \r\nfrom anyone. \r\n<P>Manny Villar\'s moment of truth when he opened Congress\' session last Nov. 13, \r\nat the cost of his Speakership, was to reveal to the Filipino people, not only a \r\nman of steadfast principles and unparalleled personal track record, but a true \r\npolitical leader who can be a source of courage, example and inspiration. \r\n<P>Speaker Manny Villar, despite his accomplishments and heroism, has remained \r\nsimple and unaffected.

INSERT INTO party VALUES (605,'Partido Ng Manggagawa','PM',2001,'Y',0,2,0,0,'','<P>\r\nThe Partido ng Manggagawa or PM aims to be the political and electoral party of the working class in the Philippines. If in other countries, especially in Europe, labor parties represent the workers, then PM is its equivalent in the country.\r\n<P>\r\nThe Partido ng Manggagawa was established at the Bahay ng Alumni last February 12 on very the day that labor leader Ka Popoy Lagman was laid to rest. At the time of his death, Ka Popoy was devoting his time into setting up and laying the groundwork for the Partido ng Manggagawa.\r\n<P>\r\nCurrently registered as a party-list group, PM will actively participate in the coming elections. PM will campaign to put three representatives in Congress. The party-list nominees of PM are three union presidents--Rene Magtubo of Fortune Tobacco, Victor Briz of Gelmart Industries and Gerry Rivera of PALEA. Aside from the three representatives targeted to sit in Congress through the party-list, PM will be fielding candidates in the local elections.\r\n<P>\r\nThe Partido ng Mangagawa is the magic formula to unite the fragmented labor movement and organize the millions of unorganized workers. It is also the missing link to advance the struggle of the working for protection against the scourge of globalization.\r\n<P>\r\nFounded on the belief that existing formations such as local unions and labor federations are limited in their capacity to effectively protect the workers’ interests in this age of globalization, PM will bring the struggle within the parliament. The goal of its participation in the elections is to enact pro-labor legislation and ensure the implementation of pro-worker policies. Its minimum platform is the protection of workers’ interests; its maximum platform is the emancipation of the working class.\r\n<P>\r\nHere lies the stark difference of Partido ng Manggagawa from other political parties. While the traditional political parties pretentiously claim to stand for the interests of the poor, PM will clearly carry the workers’ class standpoint. All of these traditional political parties are proven and undeniably pro-capitalist. The platform, leadership and membership of PM, in its heart and soul, are purely for the interests of every workingman.\r\n<P>\r\nPM is organized at the grassroots level, with individual memberships. Therefore, PM will go beyond existing labor formations and federations since PM membership is not union-based. Each member will undergo seminars and orientation regarding PM before being considered full-pledged PM members. This kind of organizational formation is geared towards developing the labor vote in the Philippines.\r\n<P>\r\nPartido ng Manggagawa believes and will work for the creation of a solid labor vote. For years, labor has given their vote to traditional politicians for the mere fact that there is no political party concretely carrying their interests. With the establishment of the Partido ng Manggagawa, workers nationwide will have a party with which they can confidently give their vote and believe that this party will truly fight for their cause.\r\n<P>\r\nThe concept of a labor vote is the like the block voting delivered by Iglesia ni Cristo or El Shaddai. Manalo or Velarde do not have to go to Malacanang to get a hearing, instead politicians and officials themselves pay their respects to the two religious leaders. The labor vote during elections and labor power in the streets will compel the government and politicians not to ignore the voice and demands of the working class.\r\n<P>\r\nThe creation of a distinct and solid labor vote will be PM’s main weapon in carrying out its platform. The labor vote, with a single command, will be used for the government to give due respect to the working class. The labor vote will give a lesson to anyone who will go against the interests of the working class. This unity of the working class, and not the PM itself, will ultimately be the direct and actual instrument that will bring about the social change and social justice for the working class.','<P>\r\nIpaglalaban ng Partido ng Manggagawa sa Kongreso at lansangan ang mga sumusunod:\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Minimum:</B> Proteksyon ng manggagawa sa salot na globalisasyon.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>Ipaglalaban ang sapat na sweldo para mabuhay nang disente at marangal ang isang pamilya.

A shortcoming in the sense that Edsa 1  failed to address the ensuing complacency and apathy  of people especially the youth who seemingly fell into slumber after a euphoric victory – thus allowing the rise to power of an incompetent government. \r\n<P>\r\nWe believe, that more than ever, the current reality is akin to a knowledge-based and Information Technology enabled politics, with the youth as its pillar and bridgehead.\r\n<P>\r\nWe believe that in the immediate future, knowledge and information shall represent the most important resource of the new system of wealth creation in the unfolding new economy.\r\n<P>\r\nWe believe that in the new economy, People’s access to information technology is as important as providing them access to other factors of production like, land, raw material and capital.\r\n<P>\r\nWe believe again that the youth shall play a very important role for our country ‘s effective participation in the highly competitive and connected world with a so called digital economy. \r\n<P>\r\nWe believe that the youth possesses the greatest  potential to effectively steer societies and small economies in transition,  (like cooperatives and other grassroots-based enterprises) to the new economic order.\r\n<P> \r\nWe believe that the youth in a conducive environment, shall serve as a well-spring of novel business ideas and shall  play the role of an accelerator in the new economy where speed and innovation is of prime importance. \r\n<P>\r\nWe believe that the youth especially the students, being a pulsating sector, is in the best position to bring the benefit of the new economy in general and information technology in particular, to the grassroots level, thus, narrowing  the Digital Divide.\r\n<P>\r\nWe believe that with a favorable environment,  the youth can immediately emulate the “learn and earn” opportunities in the knowledge-based new economy turning campuses into one of its  building block.\r\n<P>\r\nWe believe that, today and more true than ever in this country’s history, the youth indeed, is the hope of the fatherland.','[Source:  brochureIT.doc brochure sent to info@vote.ph by Alexander E.

It is supported by former leading youth activists who worked with the poverty stricken people, listened to their cries and felt their pains. Like the proverbial wave, activists are deeply immersed (within the grassroots) when the sea is calm but rise to heights when there is storm.  With today’s realities, the activists are ready to rise once again to new heights as the strong wind of change is blustering the country. \r\n<P>\r\nThe birthing of ALTERNATIVE ACTION came amidst a social condition where CHANGE in the economic and political arena was so rapid that while it offers rich opportunities it is also loaded with dangers to humanity, our country, our organizations and ourselves. \r\n<P>\r\nWith the swiftness of change, the compression of the three\r\ndimensions of time: past, present, and the future is transpiring in ALTERNATIVE ACTION.  Drawing inspiration from the past, ALTERNATIVE ACTION relives the wisdom, dedication, creativity, fervor, passion and selflessness of former youth activists.  With in ALTERNATIVE ACTION, such attributes are being relevantly imbued to the effort of all parties especially the youth and students  in facing the  challenges of the present reality .  This in turn leads ALTERNATIVE ACTION  to identify new development imperatives in preparing the whole country for the fast approaching future.  \r\n<P>\r\nALTERNATIVE ACTION recognizes the important role of the Youth in bridging the lessons of the past to the conduct of the present and to the vision of the future.','[Source:  nrebrochIT.doc brochure sent to info@vote.ph by Alexander E.

The government has not eliminated the conditions that foster crime.  And when a crime is committed, the chief concern of criminal justice agencies has been apprehending and dealing with the criminal, and that the  victim  or witness is frequently forgotten or further victimized by the criminal justice system. \r\n<P>\r\nWe believe that the present justice system in the country provides more rights and attention to perpetrators of crime than to victims.  Crime victims have few participatory rights, too few agencies/organizations providing scarce services and assistance and no laws passed that articulate and protect victims’ rights like in other countries. The number of crime victims is increasing by leaps and bounds.  Certainly, VACC and crime victims’ groups would not want any increase in their membership anymore.  \r\n<P>\r\nHow the justice system will handle itself in pursuing justice for the Filipino people as victims of Erap\'s criminal and corrupt governance is a test case. Just the same, there is a need to institutionalize a law basically working for the interests of victims of crime, particularly of common crimes.\r\n<P>\r\nWe want Congress to pass a Crime Victims Rights Law that will give victims the same dignity, respect, and rights afforded the other players in the criminal justice system. A Law that recognizes victims\' rights that includes five basic rights: \r\n<P>\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>the right to be treated with dignity and respect, \r\n<LI>the right to be informed; \r\n<LI>the right to be present; \r\n<LI>the right to be compensated and \r\n<LI>the right to be heard throughout the criminal justice process. \r\n</OL>\r\n<P>\r\n<B>VACC LEGISLATIVE  AGENDA</B>\r\n<P>\r\nVACC believes that crime is a social menace.  But corruption is a social base of criminality.  Crime and corruption are symptoms of social inequalities in Philippine society.  These social inequalities produce the poverty of the many.  And the poverty of the many stems from the greed of the few.    That is why our battle cry is :  fight crime and corruption!   Because they are symptoms of a larger problem,  VACC believes that to attack at the roots of the problem, we must address the social roots.  THAT can be done with crime victims being in solidarity with the basic sectors of society fighting for social justice.\r\n<P>\r\nSince year 2000, over 100,000 Filipinos  were victims of heinous  crimes. These do not include other victims like the victims of war in Mindanao and political violence.  These aren\'t just statistics, they\'re people.   Their lives and the lives of their families have been changed forever. \r\n<P>\r\nTherefore,  VACC must work for securing basic changes that must be institutionalized in the Philippine justice system.   It must work along with other sectors in promoting wholistic advocacies while focusing on the following to fight crime and corruption:\r\n<P>\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI TYPE=\"A\">VACC  Legislative Agenda\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>Crime Victims’ Law to contain\r\n<OL>\r\n	<LI>Compensation Act and Program for Victims of Heinous Crimes\r\n	<LI>Victims-Witness Assistance Provisions\r\n	<LI>Anti-Recidivist Offenders provisions\r\n</OL>\r\n<LI>Setting up of a  Crime Victims-Witness Office or Center under the DOJ     to  provide  for  various services to victims in the course of achieving justice     and to provide for faster  and more complete victim recovery from the effects of      crime through  victim and witness assistance \r\n<LI>Declaration of a National Crime Victims’ Rights Week – with a corresponding Public Awareness Campaign on Crime and Justice System\r\n<LI>Community Justice System (Barangay-based Jury System)to provide for effective community-based intervention and supervision that are critical to reduce the risk of further victimization.\r\n<LI>Revision of the Police Orientation & Training Curriculum\r\n<LI>Inclusion of the Crime Victims Rights and Vigilance on the Justice System as a social policy\r\n<LI>Participatory Review of Parole/Pardon  System (with citizens’ groups)\r\n<LI>Community-based Public Accountability Act (for all public officials in the LGUs, PNP, AFP, courts, jails, various local departments) which will require monthly reporting and accounting to the community about their actions and programs including funds and resources use. More severe penalties for public servants and doing away with the SPECIAL TREATMENT or VIP Treatment practice for erring public officials\r\n<LI>Establishment of Community-based Multisectoral Consultation Board on the barangay level up to the provincial level to be composed of LGU, 5 pillars of justice including legitimate people’s organizations (civil society) for consultation and action-driven programs; this will be one of the mechanisms for the Community-based Public Accountability Act\r\n<LI>Law Against Transnational Crimes like Money Laundering and NArcopolitical involvement (Money Laundering is using crime money like drug money to set up businesses to \\\"legalize\\\" the money and NArcopolitics is political groups and politicians being funded by drug syndicates and drug money)\r\n</OL>\r\n<LI TYPE=\"A\">Projects and Programs\r\n\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>A Handbook for Crime Victims in the Philippine Setting   which can be\r\n            distributed  directly to victims of crime with additional  pamphlet on  \\\"The \r\n            Criminal Justice System and You\\\"\r\n\r\n<LI>A GUIDE TO SURVIVAL  for Family and Friends of Homicide Victims to provide assistance, information, tips\r\n<LI>Launching a Web-based database of information  on Crime Victims’ Cases\r\n<LI>Education curriculum development to include special curriculum on The Different Aspects of Criminal Justice and Social Policy\r\n<LI>Launching of petitions like Parole Block Petitions on  efforts in stopping the early release of convicted murderers, death penalty for recidivist and \r\n      hardened heinous crimes convicts and against crime & corruption \r\n      fostering policies, laws and programs etc\r\n<LI>Endorsements of programs, candidates, policies, projects that promote VACC mission to restore and maintain balance in  criminal justice system – which has put criminals\\\' rights ahead of victims\\\' rights.\r\n<LI>Education  and political action to enhance victims’ rights, public safety, promote effective  crime-prevention measures and strengthen the rights of crime victims;   promote education prevention programs \r\n<LI>Organization of barangay-based VACC partnerships and alliances with five pillars of the criminal justice system with stress on alternative value education or conscientization to fight crime and corruption.\r\n</OL>\r\n</OL>\r\n<P>\r\nWe may never have a crime and victim-free society in the immediate future but  we will never know if we don\'t try.  All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.  VACC will support in Congress all legislative acts that will address the root problems of crime – poverty of the many because of the greed of the few,\r\n<P>\r\nAs to having different anticrime and crimevictims groups, it is the same with labor, women, peasants, national minorities and others which have different groups or organizations too.  \r\n<P>\r\nVACC is different from other anticrime groups because it has elevated its struggle to the level of political, economic and social concerns NOT only crime and victims\' concerns.  \r\n<P>\r\nVACC believes that we should not only fight crime and if we are crime victims, our concern is not only to follow up our cases until their just conclusion.  Our long term  concern must be that because we have been victimized, we must bring victimization forward as a social issue and make this a political concern in government that must be addressed at ITS ROOTS.','','','vacc@pacific.net.ph','','','',20010511114152,'','',2001);
