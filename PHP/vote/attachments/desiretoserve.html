<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One of
the most important and shall we say godlike quality of man is his desire to
serve. Man and woman become husband and wife not only because they love each
other<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and promise to be together till
death they part (so some say), but because they deeply want to serve and care
for one another. Parents protect and serve their children until they become
independent and learn how to take care of themselves. Then too the children
resolve to serve and to take care of their parents old age come. The family is
the simplest unit where the desire to serve is best exemplified. And to serve
mankind comes in different forms and of inclusive effect. While serving others
they serve themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Farmers till the
soil not only to earn a living for his family but primarily that non-farmers
may have foods to eat. Teachers devotedly teach the young to be in the future
better citizens and leaders of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>nation.
Builders and carpenters construct building and home for the shelter of others.
Food and product manufacturers produce products for other to use that make life
easier and worth living. Doctors cure the sick, religious leaders preach the
teachings of holy books to strengthen the faith of men that they truly reflect
the image of God. Many political leaders want to lead a nation with resolved to
attain their goal most effectively and efficiently.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>The desire to serve his nation
and the people is driven by various forms of motivation often laced with
personal and selfish interest and less often selflessly. In fact, a television
commentator has said that this 2001 election has shown very unique qualities
both from the voters and the candidates alike. Voters and candidates are
emotionally charged. Voters actively participated in the selection process of
candidates that will be elected as public servants. Before and after the
election, voters want those elected public officials to provide them services
of varying interest ranging from material benefit, emotional, and mental
satisfaction. Voters realize the value of their vote and are now demanding more
from the candidates the expected services from them once elected.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Voters are looking deeper into the political
platform, qualifications, credentials, integrity, and competence of candidates
who they will vote for. And those young voters who failed to vote because of
their failure to register as new voters participated in the selection process
of candidates to make the election clean and honest. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In this
2001 election, millions of pesos were spent by candidates to get<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>elected. Money is used to buy votes and
corrupt the voting people in their quest for position and power which
aggravated and lowered the moral standard of the nation. The money being spent
is way above the expected salaries that they will earn should the candidates be
elected into office. This is highly anomalous unless the candidate is rich and
willing to spend his fortune to serve unselfishly his nation. Or the candidate
is highly qualified to the position aspired for and many of his supporters are
willing to spend their own money as donation to help the candidate
elected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Or some candidates are
determined to get themselves into office for power, name, and fame. So before
the conclusion of this election process and even before the final vote is
counted and final results determined, several contending political parties are
in fact accusing each other of vote-buying and other frauds just to get their
candidates elected. Even the officials in charge of conducting the election
process are being accused of favoring certain candidates to win. Certainly the
desire to be elected is more than just to serve the nation but also to satisfy
personal and selfish interest of some candidates. Some candidates are accused
of using money, gun, and other forms of frauds to get themselves elected. This
may not be true to all candidates, but serving the people and nation through
the elected offices now is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>a ploy to
earn political power for selfish interest. Why is desire and service so strong
to compel leaders to act as they do?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Let us understand what is desire and service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DESIRE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Desire is
a wish or long for, a fuel, a force that compels or motivates one to attain a
chosen goal. Human desire is expressed request, a petition. It is an appetite,
a passion, a want or craving. Desire may be selfish or selfless. Desire is
selfish or greed when one is acquisitive, hateful, and motivated to act for the
satisfaction of his personality. Desire is selfless when his action is
impersonal, kind, compassionate resulting to the common good of all. It compels
him to act to benefit all. Selfless desire is love, vision, aspiration distinct
only to a great or holy man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SERVICE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Service
is an act of devotion to another, or an<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>act to benefit others. Service is a favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is an act of assistance to benefit other. It is altruism or
godlike quality of man. Good leaders use feeling and understanding to be able
to serve best those in want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Good
leaders know that giving fish is not the permanent solution to alleviate
hunger, but<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>teaching the poor and the
hungry how to fish by themselves and become totally self reliant.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the deeper sense, service is that
develops man’s full creative faculties and become independent and self-reliant
that promotes peace, harmony and prosperity to the nation that he led.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In other words, it is the elimination of his
dependence to the nation for personal and material needs. It is putting the
leadership of the nation into the hand of competent, honest, and dedicated
leaders who are tasked to manage the affairs of the government promoting peace,
freedom, prosperity, and most of all the highest moral dignity of men. It is
the realization that man must cooperate with all and eliminate the sense of
separateness, a distinct individuality between rich and poor in thought,
feeling, and deeds which qualities are the root and cause of all evil. A good
leader is one who realizes his unity with all and serves the people to be self
reliant in thoughts, words, and deeds. A good leader realizes that each and
every person has the potentialities to create something that contribute to the
wealth, progress, and peace of the nation provided they are given the
opportunity to live free of hunger and in health and is given the opportunity
of education and training necessary to develop his skills and talent. Leader
and follower act harmoniously. They act in accordance with the universal scheme
and law; and harmony in consciousness and thought and therefore in action is
what men understand by the term ethics. Ethics are not a convention; morals are
not a convention; they are rooted in the harmony, in the central laws of being;
they are based on the very structural harmony of the universe.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But like
a dirt that fell in the glass of clean water and so spoil the water, greedy
political leaders use money and superficial act of service to deceive many into
voting him into office for deeper selfish and personal interest. Graft and
corruption prevail and moral degeneration follows the nation. Politicians who
cheat and buy votes<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>to win an election
are selfish and cannot be expected to lead and manage honestly and dedicatedly
expected on the position aspired for. Those who won an election by cheating
cannot be expected to implement the laws of the land since those who have seen
his examples cheating to win an election cannot be morally persuaded to obey
the laws wholeheartedly. Manmade laws will be written without effective
implementation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>CONCLUSION</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
desire to serve is inherent to all men regardless one is at the lowest economic
ladder of the society or at the highest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The performance of service is a happy or blissful an act<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>from the offering of water to the thirsty, a
flower to a love one, a kind and loving smile to a stranger, and a gift or
offering to some one care for so long as the action is wholeheartedly given and
without attachment or expectation of return. Obeying traffic rules, placing
garbage to designated container/place, being polite and respecting freedom and
rights of other as he seeks rights and freedom for himself, these and many more
are services all including the masses can serve the nation without cost and at
ease and with happiness. These are the kind of services all can give freely and
most precious and abundantly without cost to themselves and will save the
government the cost of manpower services to realize savings for other more
important services. This is the kind of services that bring smile and comfort
not only the receiver but equally to the giver. All, from the leader to the
masses can give these services that certainly bring comfort and smile to the
receivers. These are the kind of services that bring peace and happiness to
all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But one
must be wary to the services offered by politicians who are motivated to gain
power, name and fame for selfish interest. Gift and services offered in exchange
for votes often lead later to graft and corruption. All must work together to
make our leaders lead the nation to prosperity, self reliant, dignity and high
moral qualities of the nation as a whole. Leaders must implement the laws of
the land equal to all and without discrimination. The intellectual competence
and moral ascendancy of the leader is measured by his own compliance of the
laws of the land, and not by his making them only for the benefit of the few.
He is a superior leader when he can lead by examples obeying and implementing
the laws of the land than by making new laws and shelves them gathering dust in
the court of justice. Leaders are elected to serve the people and the nation,
not themselves.</p>
