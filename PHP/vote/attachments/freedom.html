<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>Following the rule of succession
as expressed by the Philippine constitution, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo
has succeeded as President of the Republic of the Philippines when former President
Joseph Ejercito Estrada left Malacañang Palace on January 20, 2001. During the
impeachment trial against former President Joseph Estrada the prosecutors were
forced to leave the impeachment trial and protested because eleven
senators-judges prevented the opening of the second envelope containing vital
evidences supporting the charges against the former president.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The charges against the former president
showed that he enriched himself of billions of pesos by various illegal means.
People throughout the Philippines rallied and demanded the resignation of the
former president. The people demanded that the wheel of justice to prevail on
the various corruption and plunder charges against the former president. The
suppression to reveal vital and important documents against the various charges
against former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada inflamed and angered many. The
Supreme Court recognized the vacancy in the office of the president and
affirmed the legitimacy of President Arroyo’s ascension to the highest office of
the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is charged of plunder and is put to
jail without bail, his supporters started to rally behind him and within few days
sizable number of his supporters gathered and stayed at the Edsa Shrine. Then
on May 1, 2001, the crowd supporting the former president walked and went
reaching the gate of the Malacañang Palace demanding his release and allowed
him to return to his former position. Some died and many were hurt from the
side of those demanding the return of the former president to Malacañang and
from the police and military personnel maintaining peace and order given the
very volatile situation prevailing at that moment. Millions worth of properties
were damaged and lost because of the riot. Those supporting the former
president want him to be back to his former office in due respect to the l0
millions voters who placed him to the position. On the other hand, President
Arroyo explained that the legal cases of the former president is not political
but that the rule of law on the many cases he is charged are heard in court. Former
President Estrada is given all his rights to defend and prove his innocence.
President Arroyo also explained that a few politicians want to create chaos and
destabilize the government for selfish political interest using the masses to
promote their evil end. She declared State of Rebellion in Metro Manila to
bring back the rule of law and peace and to justice those responsible for the
illegal acts and the destruction of properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Several
approaches are available to shed lights from the events just mentioned.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Let the political, legal, and economic
luminaries elaborate the points within their skills and mastery. Let us limit
our study and understanding on the part of human nature in his continuing quest
for freedom and power as the means for peace and happiness. It is also the
feeling and thought by man to express his creative power and freedom often
selfishly and at times selflessly. There is also that varying sense of
responsibility by those who exercise vast amount of power and freedom. It is
the divine inheritance of every man to exercise power and freedom that he may
enjoy the fruit of his action so long as an equivalent amount of responsibility
are also applied to promote unity in diversity. The exercise of power and
freedom must be tempered by responsibility resulting there from.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some cannot understand the meanings of
freedom, power, and responsibility. But some crafty and selfish politicians
want power and freedom for selfish interest. Let us try to understand them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>FREEDOM</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Freedom
is a condition of being free of restraints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>To act without restraints is freedom and therefore joy. Freedom to love
one’s country is guaranteed by our constitution. In the national anthem, we
sing that one is free to love and die for the country.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Freedom is expression of joy and will
inherent of the right of each individual. It is in freedom that one experiences
the beauty of life and the joy of living. But freedom to act is not absolute.
The act must be tempered with responsibility assumed by the one acting. Freedom
to act must be tempered by the natural laws and the man made laws of the land.
Action taken beyond the bound of the natural laws and the laws of the land are
meted with corresponding negative or painful consequences. Freedom to act as he
chooses is inherent and right of all men. But action has to be measured by an
equal amount of assumed responsibility so that all can live peacefully in
diversity. Action within the bound of responsibility or morality makes man
upright and virtues. Action to serve own interest only and at the expense of
others is selfish and immoral. As the joyful bird uses his wings to fly in
freedom up in the sky so a joyful man is free expressing his capacities and
power within the bound of his responsibilities to nature and mankind alike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>POWER</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Power
is strength or force exerted. Man possesses physical, emotional, and mental
power in order to gain knowledge, experience, joy or suffering in life. An
athlete will train his body to gain physical power and excel in the game of his
choice. Man will study and work to gain emotional satisfaction and recognition.
Man will study to gain knowledge that is power. Politicians want elected to
gain power to serve the people or for selfish end. Wealth is power to do what
one wishes to gain fame, recognition and honor. There is also that power of
speech that makes man leader of his race or nation. But power is like wine that
intoxicates man to greed, selfishness, and immorality. A drunken man of power
serves only himself at the expense of his people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>RESPONSIBILITY</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Responsibility
is a state, a quality, or fact of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>being
responsible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Responsibility is
acceptance of duty, burden or obligation. It is a ring-pass-not that define
action to be within bound. It is the compass in the sea of life one is to have
to reach his quest and destination. The recognition of responsibility is
noticeable in varying degrees among men regardless of their material position
and educational training in life. Responsibility is the bound or field which
defines right action. The greater or broader the field of action, the greater
is the responsibility to be assumed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Responsibility is a moral obligation assumed by one taking action regardless
one is a leader or a follower.</p>

<h1>THE MASSES</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
interplay of forces used by some leaders among the masses who played
significant role in the gathering at the Edsa shrine resulted the following:</p>

</span><![endif]>The apparent misapplication of the justice systems. The
powerful and the moneyed can get away with their crimes, but not the poor. In
other words, powerful leaders refuse to accept greater responsibility in their
decision and action in leading the nation. Selfishness prevails over service in
running the affairs of the government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It is clear that the masses are
not only neglected by some selfish politicians but are also being used by the
politicians for their selfish interest. The masses want freedom to express
their potentialities and creativity. They want the government to help them
alleviate the burden in the maintenance of body and health. They seek
assistance from the government to provide them work that they may enjoy freedom,
develop power and assume broader responsibilities as human beings to a greater
height. Better education and social services are requested that the masses are
given opportunities for self-reliance and eventually become better citizens of
the nation.</p>
