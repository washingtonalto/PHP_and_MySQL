<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>From street cleaner to the
highest leader of a company, from religious leaders to political leaders, from
farmers, law enforcers, business and legal professionals and media have hopes
and frustrations in what are happening to our country today. Job seekers cannot
find jobs. Businessmen cannot collect on time their receivables from customers.
Borrowers cannot pay long matured bank loans. Many business establishments have
already closed shops and many more are closing. Exposes of various crimes are
the favorites of newsmen as headlines of their papers. Witnesses to crimes are
coming up to tell tales of truth or otherwise of their participation and the
masterminds of the crimes. Politicians change from one party to another to suit
their convenience and to favor their chance of getting elected next time around
or landing to a higher and bigger power and authority to reach higher fame.
Some commented that our country is deteriorating fast that it may be best to go
elsewhere to live. Others say that Filipinos are of a unique breed and can
overcome such problems as they overcome greater problems and difficulties of
the past. Some wonder why Filipinos obey faithfully foreign laws while overseas
but not so at home. Some say that we have a crab mentality and will not allow
others to succeed and so will always remain at the bottom economically in
relation to other countries. These and many more are the frustrations anyone
can hear from all sectors of the society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>There is truth
in all the above-mentioned observations and perceptions. In fact the two
“People Power” rallies of the political and religious leaders with
participation of the masses resulted in the successful change of political
leadership twice in the past. The masses participated in the people power
rallies because of the strong and vivid perception of the masses to correct
wrongdoings committed by the political leaders. The global economic meltdown
started in l998 and continuing to the present time also resulted to the reduction
of global economic activities. This resulted in lower business activities
particularly exports. This reduces the chance of finding gainful employment to
many job seekers. This reduces income of the wage earners resulting in the
increase of those living beyond the poverty level. This threat of economic
slowdown not only affects the Philippines but also its neighboring countries,
and including Europe and the United States of America.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These countries are making new economic
plans and economic policies to arrest recession. For example, to arrest
recession the Singaporean leader told his constituents to innovate and change
the ways of doing business to adopt to the changing global economic needs. He
asked the people to be self-reliant and review for possible improvement of the
business plans and the usual activities which may be effective in the past but
may not be so this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
political leaders of the nation are pushing economic and political reforms and
are implementing policies and economic activities to increase agricultural
output, expand infrastructure activities like roads and housing projects for
the masses and other projects like mass transport system and transportation of
goods designed to arrest recession and to prepare the nation produce products
that are competitive in the global market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Foreign investors are invited to come and help the nation for the needed
resources to actualize planned economic projects and increase business
activities particularly in the food production and manufacturing sectors.
Likewise, labor leaders are asking for higher wages to meet increasing cost to
maintain household needs. Some foreign investors positively responded but
several declined because of the perception that the nation is not safe to
invest their money in and the danger of kidnapping and the corrupt government
officials they are likely to ask bribes before getting the licensing approval
and implementation of projects. In short, the Philippines while enjoying
abundant natural resources and qualified manpower compared to that of Taiwan
and Singapore, do not have higher degree of trust and confidence from possible
investors to bring in needed capital and work for greater employment
opportunities. Over a year ago, a report was published covering more than 90
countries worldwide from least to most corrupt nations, the Philippines is rank
65<sup>th</sup> which means that the nation belongs to the one-third most
corrupt nations in the world. And so, many talented Filipinos cannot find good
jobs and prefer to go elsewhere at the pain and risk of leaving their families
here due to lack of business activities where they can be gainfully employed.
Investors will come only if assured that they are entering business in a
competitive but fair playing field without political influences leading to
graft and corruption. Those few who know how to deal with corrupt officials may
come but the price of exploitation far exceeds than the expected benefits to be
earned.</p>

</span><![endif]>The Philippines has abundant natural resources for use in the
business activities nationwide. Agriculture production and food processing are
businesses, which can be put up with definite positive results. The strong
political will to construct dams nationwide will assure ready supply of water
for irrigation and electricity production, including needed potable water
supply for the people. However, the indiscriminate cutting of trees and
pollution generated by unsupervised business activities by the government may
pose serious danger to people, land and natural resources and its habitation as
well</p>

the educational programs<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>to
continue<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>improving the literacy in the
technical, English, and moral development of the youth. The recent survey show
that the Philippines education is now lagging behind that of its neighbors
which will severely affect the nation’s people competence and literacy<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in the long run . This is a danger sign that
the Filipinos are showing sign of moral and intellectual degeneration and our
political leaders must look into it seriously and take corrective steps soon.</p>

</span><![endif]>The people are resilient, dedicated, hard working, non-violent
and fun loving. The two people power rallies which resulted in the change of
political leadership without bloodshed proved this point. The millions of Filipino
workers who are continuously being appreciated by their foreign employers also
proved the competence and dedication to work of this working class. Without
them, the Philippines may have suffered severely in the recent and still
on-going economic meltdown.</p>

labors, and natural resources to produce and manufacture products for own

production of goods will make the costs of production cheaper and competitive
in the world market. One of the serious problem besetting the nation is not
technical since Filipinos are technically trained and well accepted and
well-like by their employers at home and abroad. Investors are not coming to
bring capital in and technical know how to produce quality, cheap, and highly
marketable products for local needs and exports because of<span

to invest in long term infrastructure projects if convinced that they are
protected and also their investment is safe and will earn decent return of
investment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In short, the problems are economics,
political and morality. The strong influence of other<span style="mso-spacerun:

country, a jail warden is assigned to reform the criminals. The jail warden
succeeded in teaching the criminals good manners, ethics, and right conduct. He
also taught them to love his family, respect the elders and pay proper courtesy
to authority and obey the laws of the land. Soon the criminals became good
citizens and assets to the country. That part of the country became peaceful
and prospered economically because of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

that state became the envy of their neighbors. The jail warden was Confucious
and the country is China. Good ethical standard and higher sense of morality
are the answer to our social and economic problems.</p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thirty seven (37) years ago, the
newly independent Singapore had very serious economic and morality problems.
Water was rationed and few owned home of their own. Transportation and business
opportunities were scarse,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>public
phones were vandalized and inoperative, gang wars among the ethnic Chinese, Malays,
and Indians residence worsen the security of the tiny island. With sound
economic policies and effective political leadership, Singapore is transformed
into<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a leading financial and business
leaders in the world today. Singaporean nationals coming from the Chinese,
Indian, and Malays descents no longer fight one another but cooperate and work
harmoniously together. The country is clean and all obey the laws of the land.
Penalty and punishment are surely given to the offenders of the laws and peace
and harmony prevail. Recently, the writer had the opportunity to travel to
Singapore through the assistance of a travel agency. Everything went according
to the travel plan and the trip was a success. However, the travel agency
promised to give us a small souvenir which was not given. This was overheard by
the driver who at that time was already bringing us on the way to the airport
leaving Singapore in about three (3) hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Even beyond his responsibility, the driver told the travel agency the
unfulfilled promise and within two hours while we were waiting at the airport,
the small souvenir came with apology. The driver said that a promise must be
fulfilled and as a Singaporean, it is his responsibility to protect the dignity
of his nation. Trust and confidence to a nation is built by this small event in
daily life. We have many examples of this kind from our honest Filipino taxi
drivers who return valuables to the rightful owners. Can we expect from our
leaders of the land to do the same?</p>
