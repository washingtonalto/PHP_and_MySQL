<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Because
of politics, economics, and moral issues, two main groups are hotly
arguing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Philippines President<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Joseph Ejercito Estrada<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is removed from office through resignation
or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>impeachment. This is the first time
in the history of the nation that the President is impeached.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because of this the two main protagonists
are working hard to win the heart and mind of the senators who will judge the
President guilty or not, as charged. The whole nation and the world will be
watching the proceeding with mixed emotion and anxiety awaiting the outcome.
While the trial is going on, the Philippine economy is showing sign of cracking
primarily because of the business leaders<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>want to see<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the final outcome before
implementing their business plan<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>either
to reduce or increase business activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Foreign investors are also wary to continue their business presence in
the country and trust the present administration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
two political camps are doing all they can using money and political resources
to be on top and become the dominant political power to rule the country. The
opposition expects to manage the political affairs of the government if the
President is ousted. On the other hand, President Estrada wants to stay in
power until 2004, his six year term of office. The opposition wants President
Estrada out justifying that the four impeachment charges will make him unfit to
govern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand, the lawyers
of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the President are using all the
legal tricks and scheme to retain and advance his political interest.
Seemingly, they use all means to justify ends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
economy is showing sign of slowing down and businessmen and people are
worried.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the economy is affected,
there will be severe economic consequences which<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>bring about<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>business and
production shutdown resulting to massive unemployment and spiraling costs of
commodities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many are going to the
streets to rally for the resignation or impeachment of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>President Estrada.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Equally, the men of President Estrada are putting up<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>counter charges against the opposition.
Seemingly, the power to govern is the issue at hand. But looking deeper into
the problem and admitting that there is a need for strong leadership in
government to arrest the breakdown in the political and economic stability of
the nation, the more acute and real problem besetting the nation is a morality
problem now facing the nation and its leaders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the political front, it is evident that the high and the middle income groups ,
including the educated ones favor the resignation or impeachment of
President<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Joseph Estrada.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The business community<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>too is very much in favor for his ouster
from the presidency. However, the poor and the uneducated which comprise the
majority of the masses still favor the retention of the President to stay in
office. Clearly, those who do not understand the consequences and the
implication of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the charges of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>alleged wrongdoings of the President<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>want him to continue in office. The
President popularity as a hero in many of his leading role in his earlier movie
career help much to maintain his popularity to the uneducated masses. But those
who understand managing a nation and businesses do not favor him to hold on
running the affairs of the government. As the result, the President is
impeached on four counts as follow:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The desire for material
possession and security from wants arise from the fear of man from hunger, need
for shelter, and protection from intrusion on their personal abode and home.
The selfishness and greed are the result of fear of sufferings and insecurity
in the maintenance of the need of their bodies and want of comfort. The pride
for wealth, power and fame are the result of mans need for recognition and
respect from other human beings. It is easy to understand that the selfish but
practical and realistic man will do anything to secure food, shelter, clothing
and other personal properties and possession for himself and his family. And as
he develop his intellect and influence his quest for recognition, power and
authority also expand to satisfy more his selfishness, greed, and other
psychological and material ambition.</p>

regardless of his position in life has that divine discontent felt within him
other than material possession and recognition in life. He can see the
injustices happening around him and wish somebody to stop it. He can see graft
and corruption happening and that too must stop and the actor and perpetuator
punished. He feels that man need a certain kind of morality to direct his
thought, feeling, and action in the conduct of life. Unlike animal that is only
guided by instinct and act only for own self-protection and<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>preservation, man has mind and moral values
to guide his life. Religions make him aware that he is spiritual<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>being and has mind to discriminate right and
wrong in the conduct of life. He agrees that man lives not by breed alone. He
understand that mans life must be full of love, righteousness, compassion and
service to fellowmen. The use of intellect to circumvent justice and
righteousness must stop and let truth come out and prevail among mankind.
Intellect must be used as light to shed out darkness, selfishness, and greed.
Intellect must be used to see the beauty of creation of God and as tool to
serve mankind. He must work not only to save him from damnation but more to
make his soul perfect as God the Father is perfect. Right values and action is
the first step towards this direction. One therefore is encouraged to adopt
idealistic way of life as oppose to purely materialistic way of life.</p>

ambition and will execute them at whatever costs it take. He will be willing to
spend a fortune to realize his ambition, bribe constituents to get him elected,
compromise and engage in horse-trading to stay course with his leadership ambition
