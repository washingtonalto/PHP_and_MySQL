<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A television host once asked “ Is Filipino still
worth dying for? There are many who responded yes or no and the reason why to
the question to justify the answer. Another friend told me apparently as a joke
that these days, crime pays considering that many wealthy and politically
powerful persons enjoy political, economic comfort, power and perceived
respectability from the society primarily due to the immoral ways they acquire
wealth, power and fame. Many of these crooks are not persecuted and brought to
the hall of justice since they use money and power to intimidate and silence
the few who dare to expose their wrongdoings. I once heard that a crooked but
very wealthy businessman once asked a ranking government official how much is
she worth to drop the case of tax delinquency now in court. When she refused,
the case is continued to be challenged in court by the businessman who
hires<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>talented lawyers<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>with help from some powerful politicians to
delay if not destroy the case once and for all. He boasted that it is cheaper
to pay legal fees and bribe some legal luminaries and politicians than to pay
taxes correctly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The kidnapping incidents all over the country and
proliferation of the illegal drug business that destroy man are a sign that the
moral fibers of those engage in it are low. They are primarily motivated to
serve selfish interest at the expense of the nation as a whole. Worse, there is
perception and allegation that some of those who are task to stop the
kidnappers and drug pushers are equally guilty of participation in the crime by
allowing the kidnappers escape and drug pushers elude conviction. There are
also allegations that some ransom money finds its way to the law enforcers who
are task to stop the crime. Ask your friend overseas and if you have a chance
to travel abroad experience it yourself and find out<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>how bad the image the country is hurting the Filipino overseas.
Consequently less foreign investment flows into the country, and the tourism
industry is severely affected because of the kidnapping incidents. These are
now hurting the nation in general.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A few who dare to expose or to confess their
participations to the crimes mentioned above are being discredited and gang up
by those politicians and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>law enforcers
who are afraid that they may later on be exposed of yet unknown and undetected
wrongdoings. Much time and energy of lawmakers are being spent<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>to discredit those who expose the crimes
than establishing the commission of the crime and creating new laws to prevent
its recurrence and persecuting those who committed the crimes itself. Some say
that if we can only implement and enforce half of the existing laws of the land
we will be much better-off<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>economically, politically and morally than ever before. They must be
reminded that if there is smoke there is fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Or when asked what to do to the sinner Mary Magdalene, Lord Jesus said.
“ He who is pure and sinless of the sin charged on her cast the first stone.”
None of those present dare to stone her. Some of our selfish leaders want to
make laws as a show of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>power, never
serious and even afraid of implementing them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'><span style='mso-tab-count:

is attracted to wealth, power and fame. Everyone wants money to secure for his
bodily need and comfort. Everyone needs power to promote self-steem and
importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everyone wants fame and
honor as sign of recognition and superiority among his peers. All these he
wants as expression of happiness and freedom. Happiness is a joy of living, an
expression of his presence in this physical world and using all the means of
money, power and fame can give. Freedom is the power to create and actualize
that which he thinks necessary for his own well-being. As the world daily<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>rotates around the sun experiencing day and
night, sunny, rainy, snowy and misty, so is man experiences happiness and
pain<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in spite of wealth, power and
fame. The more he attaches himself in wealth, power, and fame, the more he
becomes selfish and fearful of losing his possession. Then all means are
resorted to retain them and so crime is committed to perpetuate his wealth,
power and fame. He becomes the center of his world. Anybody that crosses his path
is a threat and must be crushed. He becomes selfish<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>will cheat,<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>kill, lie, and do anything to protect
selfish interest. He is engrossed and so attached to what the physical world
can give<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and has forgotten what his
religious faith and spiritual nature about him is all about. Evidently, many
become selfish and seek wealth, power, and fame in their quest for the elusive
and everlasting happiness. What they get is temporary and illusory pleasure
followed sooner or later by excruciating pain. Science explains it as the law
of cause and effect, or in nature, the law of compensation. Lord Jesus said,
“What you sow, you reap.” One who sow selfishness and greed the effect of which
cause pain to others, gets back sooner or later its painful result.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Needless to say, one can cite innumerable
examples of this principle among the disgraced ordinary men and leaders of
mankind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'><span style='mso-tab-count:

intelligence. The spiritual man uses his material (physical, vital, and
emotional) bodies and intelligence towards happiness and perfection. The
ultimate sanction of morality is the spiritual man’s desire for happiness in
his true home and the escape from misery from this transitory place called the
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>John Stuart Mill defines
happiness as the state of absence of opposition. An ancient sage defines
happiness in more forcible terms: Every kind of subjugation to another is pain
and subjugation to one’s self is happiness. The whole system of nature is
moving in a particular direction, and this direction is determined by the
composition of two forces, namely, the one acting from the pole of existence
towards ordinarily called matter and other pole called spirit moving the
opposite direction. The very fact that nature is moving shows that these two
forces are not equal in magnitude The forces directed towards spirit is the one
which must, though not without hard struggle, ultimately prevail. This is the
great directing energy of nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If an
individual attempts to move in a direction other than that in which nature is
moving that individual is sure to be crushed. The only way which happiness
might be attained is by merging one’s nature with the great mother’s nature and
following the direction in which she herself is moving.</p>

primarily to train and develop the youth learn the necessary skills to make

to become achievers in sport and intellectual undertaking making many to become
extremely self centered and individualistic. In some cases achievements are
reached through dishonestly and at all costs. In other words the goal to
educate the youth is materialistic and selfish. There is less attention to<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>on the purposes of life and the wholesome
art of living. Therefore, to reverse the enhancement of selfishness and greed

cooperation, tolerance, love, harmony and these are through the teachings

Living in harmony and cooperation must prevail instead of cut-throat
competition. Contest is a measure of how one develops his physical or mental
faculties and not a measure of superiority among his peers. The man’s
development of greater physical and mental faculties is indicative of greater
service to fellow men. The true essence of religious teachings may likewise be
taught to strengthen the moral fibers of the youth.</p>

is for one to reach illumination or nirvana, meaning his true and pure
spiritual nature free from gunas or material forms and its qualities and

few conflicts are still happening at the present time not because one religion
is better or superior than the other or God which is all good, all loving, and
most merciful has created inferior religion to lead some of his children to
eternal damnation but because of the emphasis given on differences and methods

family life, no sensible father will teach his children evil and wrong things

perfection in life but their father will always be supporting them. Different
