September 11, 2001 starting 8:45 a.m. New York time and onward for almost a
day, people by the hundreds of millions<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>watched on televisions worldwide or actual eye witnesses to the most
horrific terrorism unfolding in modern times and against the most militarily
and economically powerful nation by slamming two hijacked commercial airplanes
into the buildings bringing down like houses of glass the twin ll0 floors
tallest buildings in the world. In addition, two lower buildings within the
area also collapsed and more buildings are damaged in danger of
collapsing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A third hijacked commercial
plane was slammed into a military building in Pentagon, Washington, D.C., the
military main headquarters of the United States of America. A fourth hijacked
commercial plane missed its supposed target and slammed in forested area in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Hundreds firefighters and police officers perished while trying to save
lives and put off the fires. Thousands died and billions of dollars lost from
such act of terrorism. The attacks of the Japanese military forces during the
Second World War on the American military forces at Pearl Harbor created also
such terrors to the Americans and united them and resolved which they did to
win the war. But the recent terrorism that destroyed the World Trade Center
twin towers and the partial destruction of building in the<span

civilians is considered more horrific, cruel and violent than the one at Pearl
Harbor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The

comparable in scope and magnitude in relation to the above-mentioned acts of
terrorisms in New York and Washington, DC and yet still acts of terror are
those kidnapping incidents happening in our midst. Terrorists and kidnappers
who took victims for ransoms are affecting the tourist industries and
preventing investors to come and do business in the Philippines. Kidnapping
instill fear from the peaceful and non-violent people and more so to the
victims. Some political/religious groups to create chaos for political and/or
economic gain commit it and such creates political instability and economic
uncertainty to the nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Terror
is an intense, overpowering fear. It is object, occurrence and anything that
instill such fear. It is violence toward private citizens, public property, and
political enemies promoted by a political group to achieve or maintain
supremacy. It may be an annoying or intolerable pest and nuisance. Terrorism is
the use of terror, violence and intimidation to achieve an end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Man
is the being that commits most of the acts of terror. While some animals show
their strength and power to defend foods, territory and domain, those powerful
animals seldom if at all commit violence to instill fear among its kind. But
man in spite of his supposedly superior mind and intelligence is capable to
commit terrorism worse than that of animal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
acts of terror were practiced and used by many since the ancient times.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Often the strong are the ones who used it
against the weak or the defeated. For example, in war, the victors get the
spoil. The weak too use terrors to harass and to destabilize the government in
power. This they do for economic benefits later or for the expected political
fortune and conversion of faith of those defeated when those in power fail and
fall. There are leaders so frustrated in the coming of justice for long
perceived injustices that they go to hill and execute justice themselves. In
some cases politicians use terrorism to get elected and perpetuate themselves
in power. Political position is power hard to give up like wine that
intoxicates the drinker. The aim to serve his constituents is replaced by the
thirst for power, money and fame. In some distant past, there are some religious
leaders and writers who appeared to have revised and twisted the meanings of
some of the holy teachings of their faith to convert new followers into their
fold and keep them within controls. They instill fear of eternal damnation and
levy sanctions against disbelievers and violators. Contribution and blind faith
are demanded from (gullible?) followers in exchange for blessings and grace to
assure seat in heaven come judgment time. As if God can be bribed and bought
out (from His own material creation), they ask material contribution for
spiritual salvation. The act of contributing material thing or money is
charitable act of service and compassion but becomes a bribe as an exchange for
grace, a passport to heaven. Is not charity an act of service by fellow human
being<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>without expectation of returns
of whatever kind?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The demand by
religious leaders to donate money or kind may mean a very subtle form of
terrorism too since it seems that man’s spiritual perfection and salvation can
be assured in exchange for material contribution. It follows that man can
continue to commit crimes and wrongdoings against all beings in general and
mankind in particular and still receive grace and forgiveness so long as he
follows blindly his religious leaders and give material contribution in
exchange for grace and forgiveness of repeatedly committing wrongdoings. Blind
faith to a charismatic religious leader may led man to kill fellow human beings
and still thinks that God agrees to the killing which is his passport to eternal
bliss and salvation. Religious teachings are mixed up with political motives to
serve selfish end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Indeed there is
an urgent need to study and understand true religious teachings designed to
make man good all around. The foundation of all religions is to make man good
all around. Zoroastrian taught purity in thoughts, words, and deeds; love and
harmlessness to all beings by Buddhism; unity of all by Hinduism and Islam; and
devotion and self surrender by Christianity are clear examples that all religions
are taught by the Great Ones at different times and place to suit the
temperaments and the people to make man good all around. Other religions taught
men their true spiritual nature and their potentialities toward reaching
perfection. As time went on, the succeeding religious leaders and writers of
holy books knowingly or otherwise may have twisted the meanings of some of the
teachings that created frictions and conflicts within their faith and that of
other faiths. Others concentrate on the minor interpretation of differences
that widen conflicts and created disunity and disharmony leading to the
formation of different religious sects. For example, is it normal for a human
father to ask one son to kill another disobedient son as sign of love and
devotion to him? Certainly no father will ask such wrongdoing more so to
tolerate any son to commit such crime. Can the God, our Father consent His
children, mankind that is, to kill one another just because of different faiths
and they express kind of temperaments and the different ways they developed in
themselves goodness, unity, perfection and love to their Father? Certainly NO.
Then why do we resort to violence to prove a point and assert our faith on
others like what happened in the religious wars during the middle age and some
others in more distant past? Then why do we quarrel when we interpret
differently the teachings of the Great Ones?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Certainly the holy books recording the teachings of the Great Ones must
be good and helpful to mankind. But it may be possible that some writers in
some very distant past may have twisted some meanings changing the essence of
the original teachings that created confusion and conflicts. The changes in
meanings polarize the faith of men and resulted to wars, killings, and other
destructive consequences. Some people observed that the destruction of World
Trade Center buildings and the Pentagon in the United States of America, the
continuing war in the middle East and the kidnappings and conflicts between the
Muslim and the Christian Filipinos in the Philippines are the results of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the on going religious/political conflicts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>An
ancient sage said that man is spirit and matter link by intelligence. The
illumination, realization of unity, purity and perfection of man is reached
when he realized his spirituality, not materiality and thread the path to
holiness as directed by the religion and true teachings of his faith and by the
Great Ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Man is like a child holding
a lighted lamp, his intelligence. That light can burn as well as guide him in
his spiritual quest to unity, illumination and perfection. Improperly used,
that led him to pride, greed and selfishness. Properly used that led him to
service, love, purity, tolerance, understanding and selflessness. Let our religious
leaders of the world by correct and good examples and pure teachings develop
true spiritual nature of men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
civilized nations and its people today are capable resolving religious
conflicts and differences in civilized and contrary to the barbaric manners as
happened many times in the past. The death tolls of such conflicts in the
middle age religious wars and the current ones are countless and senseless. It
is also ironic and contrary to the essence of love that the children of one
loving and compassionate God are willing to kill others to show love and
devotion and unity with Him. Long ignored because of indifference and pride and
touches the emotional and mental faculties of some of the religious leaders, it
may still be prudent that among their scholars and theologians and religious
luminaries may form study of the similarities and differences of the teachings
of all religions with complete honesty and openness. These scholars may have to
research old and long forgotten records in archives and libraries of government
and religious institutions. The punishments for political and criminal acts are
to be separated from the problems pose by religious differences in
understanding and application of faith. The similarities of the teachings will
strengthen our faith in one God and the differences will enrich man
intellectual faculties and understanding and broaden his love and compassion
very necessary in his quest for unity and perfection. They may share the
results of the study with their followers and learn and practice understanding
and tolerance from differences noted. It may be prudent to avoid proselytizing
someone else. This will promote cooperation, harmony and peace and avoid
senseless conflict and killings in the name of religion. Men as children of God
should not repeat the errors in the past when they engaged in wars and cruel
and merciless killings of fellow human beings. Harmlessness, truth, tolerance,
purity and understanding of the faith of others will promote harmony and
cooperation and altogether when spice with love will eliminate terrorism. </p>
