# PHP_and_MySQL
This is my repository of my old PHP and MySQL codes that I last maintained in 2001. Specifically, these are the PHP and MySQL codes that I used to construct https://vote.ph , an election portal used in 2001. I'm placing this to this repository for posterity's sake. The data is very old but can probably be useful for instructional purposes including the SQL tables used for the website.
